Originally discarded as worthless impurities, the crystals attract the attention of representatives of the Techno Union because of their ability to survive the extreme heat. The research and development team discovers that the crystals, dubbed crystadurium, not only withstand heat and high pressure, but they also resist blaster fire. Working with a design team from Baktoid Combat Automata, they create blaster-resistant armor plating by mixing crystal shards into the durasteel alloy used for the battle droids' armor. The war ends before the armor plating is implemented, and the plans are lost when the Techno Union is absorbed by the Empire. Years later the plans are rediscovered by an Imperial librarian, who sells the plans to several arms manufacturers. Although the armor created from these plans is inferior to the original prototypes, it is remarkably effective at stopping blaster fire. Crystadurium armor is heavier and more expensive than standard heavy armor, but it is sought by military organizations throughout the galaxy because of its ability to reduce damage from blaster attacks by 1 point per die of damage.",

The armor includes an integrated comlink in the helmet, allowing hands-free communication.\nAs a full-round action, the wearer can use the bacta tanks built into the armor. The bacta and the suit's built-in diagnostic gear grant the wearer an effective Treat Injury +10 skill for self-treatment.

A riot shield has DR 5, 20 hit points, and a break DC of 25.\nWhen held, a riot shield grants you cover (+5 cover bonus to your Reflex Defense) against all ranged attacks on any turn during which you fight defensively.

Although they can be constructed from an assortment of materials, tracker utility vests are commonly made from a tough, leathery hide treated to be watertight, stain-proof, and resistant to rips and tears.\nThe vest features pockets, pouches, and straps capable of carrying up to twenty-four small objects weighing no more than 1 kilogram each. Because the items are stored so that their weight is distributed evenly around the wearer's torso, their cumulative weight is halved for purposes of calculating the wearer's total carried weight.",

Its systems are designed in so that a wearer not proficient with heavy armor can use it competently in nonstressful situations. The suit, once donned properly, provides full life support to its wearer and also includes external thrusters to allow movement in a zero-gravity environment (speed fly 6). It also features motorized limbs, a complete set of integrated repair tools, and an external compartment to allow the user to carry any extra materials needed to make repairs. The suit's functions are controlled by a dedicated, low-level droid brain that handles all the complex systems of the suit, such as the life support monitoring system and the regulation of the external thrusters.\nVacuum pod users who have the Armor Proficiency (heavy) feat can use the following features and receive the bonuses listed. A wearer who does not have the feat can still use the suit but does not receive any of the equipment bonuses listed below, unless otherwise noted. Regardless, the wearer has any armor check penalties halved while in noncombat situations. Putting on the suit and bringing all the droid's systems online takes 15 minutes. Removing the suit takes only 3 rounds.\nComlink: The suit's integrated comlink has a range of 100 kilometers and can send and receive encrypted messages.\nLife Support: The suit provides up to 2 hours of continuous life support with air supply and protection against extreme environments, including hard vacuum.\nPowerlamp: The armor comes with an integrated glowrod, which emits a 70-sguare cone of light.\nRepair Kit: The tools integrated in the suit's motorized arms give the user a +2 bonus on all Mechanics checks while the systems function.\nStrength Augmentation: The suit's power systems grant the wearer a +4 bonus to Strength while the suit is operational.",
