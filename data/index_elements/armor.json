Originally discarded as worthless impurities, the crystals attract the attention of representatives of the Techno Union because of their ability to survive the extreme heat. The research and development team discovers that the crystals, dubbed crystadurium, not only withstand heat and high pressure, but they also resist blaster fire. Working with a design team from Baktoid Combat Automata, they create blaster-resistant armor plating by mixing crystal shards into the durasteel alloy used for the battle droids' armor. The war ends before the armor plating is implemented, and the plans are lost when the Techno Union is absorbed by the Empire. Years later the plans are rediscovered by an Imperial librarian, who sells the plans to several arms manufacturers. Although the armor created from these plans is inferior to the original prototypes, it is remarkably effective at stopping blaster fire. Crystadurium armor is heavier and more expensive than standard heavy armor, but it is sought by military organizations throughout the galaxy because of its ability to reduce damage from blaster attacks by 1 point per die of damage.",

The popularity of energy shields sparks a revolution in combat tactics, including a surge in the popularity of melee weapons and non-energy projectile weapons. Just as the spread of energy shields is a response to the prominence of energy weapons, they in turn cause warriors to adjust their tactics to deal with personal energy shields.\nEnergy shields give a character a Shield Rating, which functions exactly as vehicle and starship shields. An energy-shield generator is typically worn on the forearm or upper arm and must be activated as a swift action. Energy shields typically have 5 charges, and energy shields can only be activated once per encounter (the stress on the shield generator causes the device to overload otherwise, so the manufacturers build in fail-safes to prevent such an occurrence). Each activation consumes one charge and lasts through the end of the encounter. An energy shield only protects against weapons that deal energy damage; a weapon that deals any other type of damage bypasses the shield's SR entirely.\nEnergy shields come in three varieties: light, medium, and heavy. Each energy shield type corresponds to an armor type. A character with an active personal shield without the relevant Armor Proficiency feat takes a -5 penalty to Reflex Defense, and the wearer is denied its Dexterity bonus to Reflex Defense, though he or she still gains the benefit of the shield. Regardless of whether or not the character is proficient in the personal shield, the character always takes the armor check penalty associated with the shield while it is activated. Additionally, each type of energy shield imposes its Maximum Dexterity Bonus restriction only when activated, not when worn and inert. An energy shield can be added to a suit of armor as an accessory. An energy shield can be modified by armor templates (see below) only if the template specifically states that it can be used on energy shields, and the shield confers that benefit only when it is activated.\nThe SR provided by the energy shield determines the shield's price, as well as the type of Armor Proficiency feat required to operate the shields without penalty.

Just as the spread of energy shields is a response to the prominence of energy weapons, they in turn cause warriors to adjust their tactics to deal with personal energy shields.\nEnergy shields give a character a Shield Rating, which functions exactly as vehicle and starship shields. An energy-shield generator is typically worn on the forearm or upper arm and must be activated as a swift action. Energy shields typically have 5 charges, and energy shields can only be activated once per encounter (the stress on the shield generator causes the device to overload otherwise, so the manufacturers build in fail-safes to prevent such an occurrence). Each activation consumes one charge and lasts through the end of the encounter. An energy shield only protects against weapons that deal energy damage; a weapon that deals any other type of damage bypasses the shield's SR entirely.\nEnergy shields come in three varieties: light, medium, and heavy. Each energy shield type corresponds to an armor type. A character with an active personal shield without the relevant Armor Proficiency feat takes a -5 penalty to Reflex Defense, and the wearer is denied its Dexterity bonus to Reflex Defense, though he or she still gains the benefit of the shield. Regardless of whether or not the character is proficient in the personal shield, the character always takes the armor check penalty associated with the shield while it is activated. Additionally, each type of energy shield imposes its Maximum Dexterity Bonus restriction only when activated, not when worn and inert. An energy shield can be added to a suit of armor as an accessory. An energy shield can be modified by armor templates (see below) only if the template specifically states that it can be used on energy shields, and the shield confers that benefit only when it is activated.\nThe SR provided by the energy shield determines the shield's price, as well as the type of Armor Proficiency feat required to operate the shields without penalty.

In its most recent form, the armor combines a padded armor base with a reinforced breastplate and fully armored gauntlets. Some front-line troopers also use a fully enclosed helmet with helmet package, but this varies by unit. It is not uncommon to see officers and others opt to use Galactic Alliance uniform hats and caps instead.\nSome variations of the standard Galactic Alliance uniform incorporate a flexible blast vest and a tight-fitting, open -faced helmet into their designs. This type is especially prevalent among the fleet crews at battle stations. It provides the same bonuses as a regular blast helmet and vest (see page 132 of the Saga Edition core rulebook).",

The armor includes an integrated comlink in the helmet, allowing hands-free communication.\nAs a full-round action, the wearer can use the bacta tanks built into the armor. The bacta and the suit's built-in diagnostic gear grant the wearer an effective Treat Injury +10 skill for self-treatment.

Officers and nobles wear stun cloaks to thwart kidnapping attempts, and commandos who expect to engage in close combat also wear them. The interior of the cloak is insulated to prevent accidental shocks to the wearer.\nIf the wearer successfully makes a grapple attack or is successfully grappled by an enemy, the stun cloak deals 3d8 points of stun damage.\nBy doubling the price, the stun cloak can be upgraded to include the same capabilities as an all-temperature cloak (see page 138 of the Saga Edition core rulebook) or the camouflage poncho (see page 46). Otherwise, the stun cloak cannot be upgraded with the Armor Upgrades option from Scum and Villainy.",

Each has slightly different details, but all include the basic characteristics common to all stormtrooper armor. Though unavailable on the open market, these suits can occasionally be found on the black market (or sometimes much higher).\nStormtrooper armor (including all variants) grants a wearer who has the Armor Proficiency (light) feat a +2 equipment bonus on Perception checks as well as low-light vision. Stormtrooper armor also includes an integrated comlink in the helmet, allowing hands-free communication.\nWearing snowtrooper armor (18,000 credits) makes you immune to the effects of extreme cold (see Extreme Temperatures, page 254).

Its systems are designed in so that a wearer not proficient with heavy armor can use it competently in nonstressful situations. The suit, once donned properly, provides full life support to its wearer and also includes external thrusters to allow movement in a zero-gravity environment (speed fly 6). It also features motorized limbs, a complete set of integrated repair tools, and an external compartment to allow the user to carry any extra materials needed to make repairs. The suit's functions are controlled by a dedicated, low-level droid brain that handles all the complex systems of the suit, such as the life support monitoring system and the regulation of the external thrusters.\nVacuum pod users who have the Armor Proficiency (heavy) feat can use the following features and receive the bonuses listed. A wearer who does not have the feat can still use the suit but does not receive any of the equipment bonuses listed below, unless otherwise noted. Regardless, the wearer has any armor check penalties halved while in noncombat situations. Putting on the suit and bringing all the droid's systems online takes 15 minutes. Removing the suit takes only 3 rounds.\nComlink: The suit's integrated comlink has a range of 100 kilometers and can send and receive encrypted messages.\nLife Support: The suit provides up to 2 hours of continuous life support with air supply and protection against extreme environments, including hard vacuum.\nPowerlamp: The armor comes with an integrated glowrod, which emits a 70-sguare cone of light.\nRepair Kit: The tools integrated in the suit's motorized arms give the user a +2 bonus on all Mechanics checks while the systems function.\nStrength Augmentation: The suit's power systems grant the wearer a +4 bonus to Strength while the suit is operational.",
