Previous models of aural amplifiers were bulky and obvious, and they garbled messages almost as often as they worked. They also required power cells, limiting the degree to which they could be concealed.\nEmploying the same technology used for protocol droids, the new ambi­ent aural amplifiers can pick out sounds, analyze them, and amplify only the sounds that are likely to be useful. These devices draw power from the body heat of any warm-blooded creature that wears them, giving the amplifiers an effectively unlimited operation time. (Cold-blooded species can power the devices by placing them on a warm surface or piece of gear.) The result is a +5 equipment bonus to Perception checks to eavesdrop or to hear distant or ambient noises.",

It comes in a small canister worn on a soldier's belt or stored in a medical kit. Opening the canister releases a pouch large enough to hold a single Medium creature. When the pouch is sealed, it releases a cryogenic compound that causes the creature inside to enter suspended animation, stabilizing his or her condition for transport to a proper medi­cal facility. Bounty hunters sometimes use of cryogenic pouches to move prisoners.\nActivating a cryogenic pouch and wrapping it around an unconscious creature requires a full round action. A creature that has been reduced to 0 hit points due to poison, radiation, or damage surpassing its Damage Threshold can be stabilized without dying within 1d3 rounds of being placed inside the cryogenic pouch. The creature remains unconscious and moves -5 steps on the condition track.\nA cryogenic pouch has enough power to keep a creature alive for up to 24 hours, although it can be hooked up to another power source with a DC 10 Mechanics check. Designed for rough handling in battlefield conditions, the pouch has DR 5, but a single point of damage is enough to breach the seal. If the cryogenic pouch is breached, the character inside reverts to its previous state after 1 round.",

Luke Skywalker gains a cybernetic replacement for his right hand, lost in battle against Darth Vader-who, in turn, had much of his own body replaced with cybernetics years before.\nAttaching a cybernetic prosthesis requires the Cybernetic Surgery feat (see page 83). Once attached, the cybernetic replacement performs as well as the original limb or extremity. Common cybernetic prosthetics include arms, hands, legs, feet, and various internal organs. In addition to the cost of the prosthesis, the recipient must also cover the cost of the surgery (see Table 8-9: Services and Expenses, page 141).\nUnlike other creatures, a creature with cybernetic prosthetics takes full damage from weapons and attacks that deal ion damage.\nBecause the Force is present in all living things, but not machines, creatures with cybernetic prosthetics take a -1 penalty on Use the Force checks for each prosthetic replacement (to a maximum penalty of -5).",

During the height of the Empire, Force detectors were built using thaissen crystals from the planet Mimban that glow in the presence of Force-users.\nRegardless of the specific form, most Force detectors function in a similar manner. Using a Force detector requires 5 rounds and a DC 15 Use Computer check to successfully activate the device.

Each Force training aid focuses on one of the basic uses of the Use the Force skill. Any character untrained in the skill can spend 1 hour training with a Force training aid.

Likewise, it cannot be damaged, though the holocron itself can be (as per normal rules of attacking objects).

When any Small or larger character, creature, droid, or vehicle comes within a 3-square radius of the proximity flare, the flare launches, creating a stark, bright light illuminating a 10-square radius and eliminating concealment penalties due to insufficient lighting. Creatures can avoid tripping a proximity flare by making a DC 25 Stealth check.\nA proximity flare can be used as a makeshift weapon when it is aimed horizontally instead of vertically. The proximity flare can shoot only in a straight line, determined when it is placed. The flare makes a +2 attack roll against the first target that it contacts, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage. If used in this way, the proximity flare sputters out after the attack and provides no additional illumination.",

During the Dark Times, the repulsor pad is often used by saboteurs to transport heavy machinery or by thieves to cart off large objects without the need to use noisy vehicles or droids. Each repulsor pad occupies a single square and can be used to lift an object that occupies no more space than that single square; multiple repulsor pads can be used to lift larger objects. Activating a repulsor pad (or a group of pads) is a swift action, and a repulsor pad can move along with a character if that character uses a swift action to grab and drag the pad.

Wealthy bounty hunters, criminal masterminds, and other VIPs use shield cages to trap targets, sometimes setting the cages beneath chairs or inside doorways. A shield cage is a large flat disk, 2 meters in diameter. It must be connected to a power supply to operate and drains portable power generators after 2 hours of continuous use.\nA shield cage produces a shield bubble that fills a single square. Multiple shield cages can be linked together, each expanding the shielded area by one additional square. Targets are trapped inside and cannot move until the power is turned off. The shield is air permeable, allowing the target to breathe and communicate verbally, but nothing else can pass through the shield except damage that exceeds the shield's rating (SR 15).",

Though the vacuum mask is no replacement for a space suit, it has saved crews trapped in compartments aboard ships after the atmosphere has vented. A vacuum mask cannot be worn at the same time as armor with a helmet or any other device worn on the head.",
