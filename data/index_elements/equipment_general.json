Previous models of aural amplifiers were bulky and obvious, and they garbled messages almost as often as they worked. They also required power cells, limiting the degree to which they could be concealed.\nEmploying the same technology used for protocol droids, the new ambi\u00adent aural amplifiers can pick out sounds, analyze them, and amplify only the sounds that are likely to be useful. These devices draw power from the body heat of any warm-blooded creature that wears them, giving the amplifiers an effectively unlimited operation time. (Cold-blooded species can power the devices by placing them on a warm surface or piece of gear.) The result is a +5 equipment bonus to Perception checks to eavesdrop or to hear distant or ambient noises.",

When any Small or larger character, creature, droid, or vehicle comes within a 3-square radius of the proximity flare, the flare launches, creating a stark, bright light illuminating a 10-square radius and eliminating concealment penalties due to insufficient lighting. Creatures can avoid tripping a proximity flare by making a DC 25 Stealth check.\nA proximity flare can be used as a makeshift weapon when it is aimed horizontally instead of vertically. The proximity flare can shoot only in a straight line, determined when it is placed. The flare makes a +2 attack roll against the first target that it contacts, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage. If used in this way, the proximity flare sputters out after the attack and provides no additional illumination.",

During the Dark Times, the repulsor pad is often used by saboteurs to transport heavy machinery or by thieves to cart off large objects without the need to use noisy vehicles or droids. Each repulsor pad occupies a single square and can be used to lift an object that occupies no more space than that single square; multiple repulsor pads can be used to lift larger objects. Activating a repulsor pad (or a group of pads) is a swift action, and a repulsor pad can move along with a character if that character uses a swift action to grab and drag the pad. If two creatures attempt to pull a repulsor pad in opposite directions, they make opposed Strength checks, and the pad moves along with the victor.",

They all qualify as simple weapons, but since they aren't designed for combat, they impose a -5 penalty on attack rolls. (Droids with such tools on tool mounts don't suffer these penalties, since they don't have to deal with an oddly shaped handle.)

It compares this information to its internal database, determining the emotional state of the target and indicating if he or she is lying. The veridicator then relays this information to the wearer as a series of pulses, temperature variations, or vibrations.\nOnce activated, the veridicator needs a full round to acquire the data from a single target within 6 squares of the user. Then the veridicator provides a +5 bonus to Perception checks for the purpose of sensing deception or influence or for gambling against other players in games such as sabacc. The veridicator can be programmed for only a single species at a time. Changing the settings requires a DC 10 Use Computer check.",

As the water accumulates, contaminants and toxins are filtered out, rendering the water potable. Although the amount of water collected varies depending on the moisture content of the atmosphere, field tests conducted on Tatooine yielded enough water in a period of 16 hours to sustain a humanoid for a full day.",
