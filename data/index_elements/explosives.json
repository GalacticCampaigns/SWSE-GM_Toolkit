Retractable magnetic spikes on the bottom of the mine allow it be securely placed in the ground or attached to a metallic object, such as a vehicle or building. It can be detonated using a timer, a manual trigger (see page 101 of The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide), or a tripwire. Setting up a tripwire requires a DC 10 Mechanics check. Any character, creature, droid, or vehicle moving into a wired square detonates the mine. Multiple antipersonnel mines can be linked together with an additional DC 10 Mechanics check per mine. When one mine is activated, all the linked mines detonate, each dealing separate damage to all targets within the area of effect.\nAn antipersonnel mine damages everything in a 6-square cone in a direction that is determined when the mine is placed and activated.",

A laser trip mine is placed on the ground (in any square adjacent to you) or against any other solid surface; you then designate a single solid surface within 6 squares as the laser's terminus. The mine is triggered when any character, creature, droid, or vehicle enters a square that is part of the line between the square where the mine is placed and the square that is the laser's terminus. A laser trip mine damages everything in a 2-square burst radius.\nDesigned to take out tanks and other vehicles, limpet mines are flat and about the size of a dinner plate. One side of the mine has a handle for easy gripping, and the other side is covered with microbeads of adhesive that break on hard contact with a flat surface (such as the side of a tank), ensur­ing solid adhesion. The shaped charge of the limpet mine causes negligible damage beyond its 1-square burst radius and ignores the DR of the object or vehicle it is attached to.",
