A burrower drive enables a droid to move at half speed underground. It can also move vertically up or down at a similar rate.\nA burrower drive can be used as a weapon. The droid makes a melee attack. If the attack is successful, the droid deals damage equal to the amount it would do if it had used a self- destruct device. However, each successful attack moves the droid -1 step on the condition track with a persistent condition, as the drill gears and bits strip down and damage the droid.",

Smaller operations might use the station to issue commands and to provide automated oversight. Droids in the command station's pool must have a com link, an integrated comlink, or a remote processor in order to maintain contact with the station. Accessing the station requires the appropriate password or code cylinder. The station typically has Intelligence 14 (or the ship's Intelligence, whichever is higher) and a Will Defense of 15. \nStandard droid command stations provide the following functions with the indicated Use Computer or Mechanics check: \n• Issue a routine command to order a droid in the droid pool to carry out a specific task. If the droid is familiar with the task, or if the droid is trained in the associated skill, no skill check is required. If the command is unusual or highly specific, a Use Computer check might be required at the Gamemaster's discretion. The user gains a +10 equipment bonus to Use Computer, Persuasion, and Perception checks against the droid. Commands can be issued verbally or by keypad.\n• Coordinate multiple droids in the pool, enabling them to complete tasks more efficiently.

The target droid must be fitted with a tracking device or a restraining bolt that can be tracked by station's sensors or the facility's security network. A Use Computer check of DC 5 is sufficient to locate any such droid.\n• Receive detailed information about a droid's status, including current hit points, position on the condition track, and the operational condition of its systems and accessories. No check is required.\n• Reprogram a droid in the pool by remote or direct connection to the station (see page 192 of the Saga Edition core rulebook). \n• Translate between Binary and common languages.

To protect items entrusted into their care, these droids can have hidden courier compartments installed in their chassis. Such compartments are also favorites of smugglers who own droids. A droid with a courier compartment might walk right past a starport inspection team that is on the way to tear its master's ship apart.\nCourier compartments can be installed in four locations within a droid. A courier compartment in the torso can hold an item that is 3 sizes smaller than the droid's size. A compartment in the arm or leg can hold an item that is 4 sizes smaller than the droid's size. A head compartment can hold an item that is 5 sizes smaller. Detecting a courier compartment requires a successful Perception check with a DC equal to the droid's Will Defense +5.\nA common accessory in a courier compartment is a toaster, which destroys the contents of the compartment with a brief blast of plasma energy triggered by the droid. Installing a toaster into a courier compartment doubles the cost of the compartment.\nExample: S-3PO, a protocol droid in service to Count Czasiz, has a courier compartment hidden in its left arm. As a Medium droid, the compartment can an hold item of up to Fine size, so it can hold the skifter sabacc card the Count needs to guarantee his next win.",

Using the device requires the attacker to plug the personality downloader into one of the droid's data ports. Droids with locked access or without accessible data ports must be coaxed into complying. Once the personality down loader is attached, the user makes a Use Computer check opposed by the droid's Will Defense. If the check is successful, the personality copies itself to the droid's processor and suppresses the existing personality in 5 minutes. The process is imperfect, however. To maintain control, every 10 minutes the new personality must make another Use Computer check opposed by the original personality. The invading personality continues to use the attacking character's Use Computer skill, even though the actual character is not actively involved after the initial download is successful.",

Recharge stations provide basic droid diagnostics with a DC 10 Use Computer check, revealing the droid's current hit points, position on the condition track, and the operational status of all systems, appendages, and tools. Aboard starships, droids parked in a recharge station are secured for travel.

This software package and transmitter can be installed on any droid. Additionally, small transceivers must also be installed on the ranged weapons used with the package. Restrictions prohibit the droid from using any weapons other than those with transceivers associated with its tactician battle computer. In fact, if the droid running the tactician battle computer picks up a weapon not equipped with the transceiver, the tactician battle computer shuts down and can be restarted only after succeeding on a DC 20 Mechanics check.  \nThe droid spends a standard action to analyze the current battle conditions. The droid transmits its findings to the sensors installed on the weapons of its allies. The droid automatically grants a +2 bonus to the next attack roll made by a number of allies equal to its Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If an ally does not make its next attack before the end of its next turn, this bonus is lost. Only ranged weapons can be used with the tactician battle computer.",
