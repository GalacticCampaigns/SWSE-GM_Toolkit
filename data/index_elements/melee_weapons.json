The amphistaff can become as rigid as stone or as flexible as rope, and it can contract the muscles around its head and tail to form razor-sharp edges.\nThe amphistaff has three distinct weapon forms: quarterstaff, spear, or whip. Switching from one weapon form to another takes a swift action.\nQuarterstaff Form: A rigid amphistaff has all the qualities of a quarterstaff (see below).\nSpear Form: A rigid amphistaff can be wielded or thrown as a spear (see below). The spear's head is poisonous: If the target takes damage and the attack roll equals or exceeds its Fortitude Defense, the target moves -1 persistent step on the condition track (see Conditions, page 148).\nWhip Form: A flexible amphistaff has a reach of 2 squares (see Reach, page 161). The whip's tail deals 1d4 points of piercing damage (plus the wielder's Strength modifier) and is poisonous: If the target takes damage and the attack roll equals or exceeds its Fortitude Defense, the target moves -1 persistent step on the condition track. Instead of dealing damage with the whip, the wielder may use it to pin or trip the target (see Grapple, page 153) as though he was using the Pin or Trip feat (see Chapter 5: Feats); the wielder must be proficient with the amphistaff but doesn't need to have the Pin or Trip feat to use this feature of the weapon .\nIn any of its weapon forms, an amphistaff may be coaxed by its wielder to spit venom up to 10 squares away (a standard action). If this ranged attack hits both the target's Reflex Defense and Fortitude Defense, the target moves -1 persistent step on the condition track. An amphistaff can only spit venom once every 24 standard hours.",

Difficult to master, the weapon is deadly in the hands of a proficient wielder. Although they vary in size, a typical darkstick is about 20 centimeters long with a handle designed to be gripped between the large knuckles of a Kerestian. Masters of the darkstick can hold two or even three of the blades in each hand, greatly increasing the damage they deal. Darksticks are named for the Kerestian belief of the Great Darkness that awaits all souls.\nLater versions of the darkstick also incorporate special webs of light-absorbing cells, which shroud the wielder in darkness. Attacks from enemies who are immediately adjacent treat the wielder as if he or she were in total concealment. Creatures or characters with darkvision ignore this penalty. The darkstick wielder must be able to see in the dark or take the penalty as well.\nAny character proficient in the use of the darkstick can hold more than one in one hand, as Kerestians do. When wielding multiple darksticks in one hand, you are considered to be wielding only one weapon, but you increase the damage dice for the darkstick from 1d6 to 2d8. (The damage remains 2d8 for any number of darksticks over two.)\nA darkstick can be thrown. If your attack exceeds the target's Reflex Defense by 5 or more, the darkstick also returns to your hand immediately after the attack.",

Energy lances once were commonly carried by honor guards and ceremonial troops such as the Mon Calamari Knights, and many such weapons still in circulation bear signs of their once- proud heritage. Though an energy lance is a Large weapon, it is balanced in such a way that a Medium creature trained in the Ride skill can wield it in one hand when mounted. If an energy lance is wielded by a Medium creature that is not mounted, attacks with the weapon take a -1 penalty.\nThe electromagnetic pulse can also be channeled along the length of the staff and fired from the tip as a bolt of plasma. When used in this way, the energy lance functions as a blaster carbine with no stun setting. This use of the energy lance requires a power pack, and has the same ammunition capacity as a blaster carbine.\nAn energy lance requires two energy cells to operate. Its melee attack and its ranged attack both function underwater.\nPower lances are energy lances that lack the ability to fire bolts of plasma. These weapons are significantly cheaper and are mass-produced as secondary weapons for scouts on speeder bikes and for cavalry.",

        "full_text_description": "Lightsaber\nLightsaber\nThe lightsaber, simple in design yet difficult to wield and master, features a handgrip hilt that projects a blade of pure energy. The traditional weapon of the Jedi, the lightsaber stands as a symbol of their skill, dedication, and authority.\nThe blade of a lightsaber is generated by an energy cell and focused through crystals within the hilt. The saber can cut through most materials (except another lightsaber blade, an energy shield, or a few exotic materials), given enough time. Because only the handgrip has any weight, unskilled users have difficulty judging the position of the blade. The lightsaber's true potential becomes apparent in the hands of a fully trained Jedi, who can defend and attack with the weapon, deflecting shots or striking opponents with the glowing blade.\nA lightsaber requires a special energy cell to operate (the cost is ten times the price of an ordinary energy cell, but it lasts almost indefinitely).\nAdvanced Lightsaber Construction\n(JATM) For some Jedi and Sith, a lightsaber is not just a weapon; it is a personalized emblem of one's life and philosophy. Similarly, some players may wish to customize their Jedi hero's lightsaber to reflect the character's philosophy and fighting style, beyond the basic lightsaber construction rules found in the Saga Edition core rulebook. This following section includes a wealth of new options for players and Gamemasters looking to customize their lightsabers to better fit the characters who wield them.\nThe lightsaber construction process begins when a hero reaches 7th level. First, the player or Gamemaster must decide what kind of lightsaber to build. The standard lightsaber is the most common lightsaber in the galaxy, and it is not only the easiest to build but also requires no special training to use effectively in combat (besides the standard Weapon Proficiency feat). Once a particular kind of lightsaber has been selected, the next step is to choose a lightsaber crystal. Any character can build a lightsaber from Adegan crystals, Hum crystals, or synthetic crystals; the default assumption is that Jedi (and other lightsaber-wielding traditions) have ample access to these crystals and need perform no special quest to obtain one. However, if you wish to use a lightsaber crystal of another kind, the character may need to undergo a special adventure to obtain the crystal.\nOnce the desired crystal has been chosen and obtained, the next step is to choose any special accessories or modifications to be made. With that in mind, the construction process can begin. Special lightsaber crystals and lightsaber accessories can modify the DC to construct the lightsaber; when construction begins, using the rules on page 40 of the Saga Edition core rulebook, applying these modifiers to the standard Use the Force check DC before the check is made (the base DC is determined by the kind of lightsaber being built, as presented on Table 3-2). Once the lightsaber is complete, the Jedi attunes the weapon as normal, gaining whatever benefit the attunement provides (based on the kind of lightsaber crystal that was used) for that wielder.\nMessage From the Faculty: Creator Bonuses\n(JATM) The standard benefit for creating a lightsaber with Adegan, Hum, and synthetic crystals is a +1 untyped bonus on attack rolls with that weapon. This bonus is granted only to the person attuned to the lightsaber, and only the person that built the lightsaber can be attuned to it. Some crystals provide other benefits instead of the +1 bonus on attack rolls. Like the standard benefit, these benefits from the lightsaber crystals apply only to the person who created the lightsaber (provided he or she is attuned to the blade). If a character who is not attuned to the weapon wields it, the weapon still does normal damage and otherwise functions as normal; that person does not receive the benefits of the special crystal. The exception to this rule is crystals that change the weapon's damage type or damage dice, like Barab ingots, Bondar crystals, and Firkraan crystals; this effect applies to the lightsaber's damage no matter who wields it. A lightsaber crystal's description tells you what the bonus is for wielding an attuned lightsaber with a particular crystal.",

As a result, lightsabers required large power cells, some larger than a human hand, to function at full capacity. These power cells were worn on the belt or on the back and were connected to the hilt of the lightsaber via a long, slender cord. Around the same time that pulse-wave weapons were phased out in favor of modern blasters, lightsabers underwent a design revolution that miniaturized the power cells required to fuel the energy blade. With the development of this new technology, the Jedi devised methods of lightsaber creation that integrated these drastically smaller power cells into the hilt of the lightsaber, eliminating the need for the external power pack. With this revolution, the archaic lightsaber design was almost entirely abandoned.\nAn archaic lightsaber is somewhat weaker than the classic lightsaber due to the lack of a sophisticated power supply and the distance of the energy cell from the lightsaber's main body.\nAn archaic lightsaber requires a special power pack (which costs 600 credits) to operate.\nHolocron Lesson: Archaic Power Racks and \"Retrosabers\"\"",

However, dual-phase lightsabers include a complex array of multiple lightsaber crystals within the handle of the weapon, allowing the user to switch the blade's length from the standard length out to a length of nearly 3 meters. Dual-phase lightsabers are extremely popular during the days of the Jedi Civil War and the surrounding time periods due to the large number of lightsaber-wielding opponents a Jedi is likely to face. The longer blade setting allows the wielder to keep an opponent at a distance during a duel, but lightsabers on this setting are also more unwieldy, making it difficult to defend against enemies that get up close to the wielder.\nIn its basic setting, a dual-phase lightsaber functions as a normal lightsaber. As a swift action, the wielder can switch to the extended blade setting. While on this setting, the lightsaber increases the wielder's reach by 1 square, but the wielder also takes a -2 penalty to Reflex Defense against attacks made by adjacent targets.\nIf you use a lightsaber crystal with a special effect when constructing a dual-phase lightsaber, that crystal's effect applies to both the default set\u00acting and the extended blade setting (see also the Message from the Faculty: Dual-Phase Lightsaber Variants sidebar).\nA dual-phase lightsaber requires an energy cell to operate.\nMessage from the Faculty; Dual-Phase Lightsaber Variants\nSome Jedi adapt the technology behind dual-phase lightsabers to allow them to wield a weapon that uses two different lightsaber crystals with different effects. When constructing a dual-phase lightsaber, you can choose a lightsaber crystal as normal for the default weapon setting and also apply its properties to its extended blade setting.\nHowever, instead of gaining the extended blade setting of a normal dual-phase lightsaber, you can instead choose a second lightsaber crystal with a different effect to add to your lightsaber. If you do this, you create two settings for your lightsaber with mutually exclusive effects. When you use a swift action to change the setting of the lightsaber, you then gain the benefits of whichever crystal is attuned to that setting.\nFor example, you might choose an Hum crystal for your default crystal (gaining the +1 Force bonus on attack rolls), and then a Bondar crystal for the second phase crystal (which converts the weapon's damage to stun damage). If you switch from the default setting to the Bondar crystal setting, you lose the +1 Force bonus on attack rolls but gain the ability to convert the weapon's normal damage to stun damage.",

Energy lances once were commonly carried by honor guards and ceremonial troops such as the Mon Calamari Knights, and many such weapons still in circulation bear signs of their once- proud heritage. Though an energy lance is a Large weapon, it is balanced in such a way that a Medium creature trained in the Ride skill can wield it in one hand when mounted. If an energy lance is wielded by a Medium creature that is not mounted, attacks with the weapon take a -1 penalty.\nThe electromagnetic pulse can also be channeled along the length of the staff and fired from the tip as a bolt of plasma. When used in this way, the energy lance functions as a blaster carbine with no stun setting. This use of the energy lance requires a power pack, and has the same ammunition capacity as a blaster carbine.\nAn energy lance requires two energy cells to operate. Its melee attack and its ranged attack both function underwater.\nPower lances are energy lances that lack the ability to fire bolts of plasma. These weapons are significantly cheaper and are mass-produced as secondary weapons for scouts on speeder bikes and for cavalry.",

This results in a weapon that can smash through armored plates or solid rock. Power hammers were originally used by asteroid miners. They became popular melee weapons after a few conflicts early in the history of the Empire when mining companies found their possessions claimed by the Empire, and their miners fought back.\nExtra damage from the use of the Power Attack feat can be added to damage dealt to an object or a vehicle with a power hammer.

A shock whip consists of a metal grip from which extend long, thick wires woven together into a single strand. The metal grip houses a power cell that can send a surge of energy through the shock whip's cord, issuing an electric shock to the target.\nA shock whip is a melee weapon with a reach of 2 squares. When you hit with the shock whip, the target takes normal damage from the weapon (as listed on Table 5-1: Melee Weapons). Also on a hit, you can choose to make a grab attack (as a free action) against the target using the whip, provided the target is no more than one size category larger than you. Unlike a normal grab attack, you make a second attack roll at the normal attack bonus with the whip, and you do not take a -5 penalty on the attack roll. If this second attack roll hits, the target is grabbed. As a swift action once per turn, you can automatically deal 2d6 energy damage to a target grabbed by the shock whip (no additional attack roll required).\nIf you have the Trip feat, you can choose to use the shock whip to knock the target prone instead of making a grab attack.\nWhile grabbing a target with the shock whip, you cannot use the weapon to make attacks against any other targets.\nA shock whip requires an energy cell to operate.",

Shockboxing gloves protect the wearer's hands and also deal damage to any character hit by them. Shockboxing gloves are similar to stunning gauntlets (see page 202 of the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide). However, unlike stunning gauntlets, shockboxing gloves have various settings, from lethal to a light shock (for sparring) as well as a stun setting.\nShockboxing gloves provide a +1 bonus to damage with a successful unarmed attack. They can be set to stun as a swift action, converting the wearer's unarmed damage to stun damage (and providing the +1 bonus to stun damage).\nShockboxing gloves are two sizes smaller than their wearer (for example, a pair of shockboxing gloves designed for a Human are Tiny). The way shockboxing gloves are worn prevents the wearer from being disarmed or from dropping them.",

The leading edge of a tehk'la blade is serrated, and vibration inducers cause it to oscillate at several thousand cycles per minute, enhancing its cutting power.\nThe Nagai fighting style that employs tehk'la blades relies on wounding an enemy, whittling him down until his lack of effectiveness permits a killing blow. The blades are designed to tear and rend as they are withdrawn from stab wounds, making them particularly fearsome in the hands of a trained combatant. If the attack roll made by the wielder of a tehk'la blade equals or exceeds both the target's Reflex Defense and its Fortitude Defense, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage from bleeding at the start of its next turn.\nA tehk'la blade requires an energy cell to operate.",

The blade is forged and sculpted with assistance from the Force, making it extraordinarily resilient. Although all wan-shen are constructed the same, each weapon is customized by the individual Matukai who uses it in the form of engraved symbols and artwork on the blade, usually symbolizing something meaningful to the wielder. Wan-shen are designed to break down into smaller parts to allow the weapon to be more easily stored and carried; a disassembled wan-shen breaks down into four Small objects. Assembling or disassembling a wan-shen is a full-round action.\nA wan-shen increases the wielder's reach by 1 square. The wan-shen is a double weapon.
