Specific traits are listed in the chart on page 35. You can perform only one modification at a time. Unless noted otherwise, you cannot grant more than one benefit to a single device, suit of armor, weapon, or vehicle, and you cannot apply the same benefit more than once. Before beginning the modification, you must pay one-tenth the cost of the device, suit of armor, weapon, or vehicle you wish to modify or 1,000 credits, whichever is more. Completing the modification requires one day per 1,000 credits of the modification cost. At the end of this time, make a DC 20 Mechanics check; you can't take 10 or take 20 on this check. If the check succeeds, the modification is completed successfully, and the object gains the desired trait. If the check fails, you lose all credits spent making the modification, and the object doesn't gain the desired trait. However, you may start over if you wish. Due to the specialized nature of biotechnology, only other characters with the Biotech Specialist feat can assist you, reducing proportionately the time needed to complete the modification. At the end of the modification process, they can make a Mechanics check to aid your check. The market value of a modified item is equal to the base cost of the item + double the cost of the modifications made to it (not including credits wasted on failed modification attempts). \nBIOTECH ARMOR TRAIT: \nAgile Armor: The armor's maximum Dexterity bonus increases by 1. \nFortifying Armor: The armor's equipment bonus to Fortitude Defense increases by 1. \nProtective Armor: The armor's armor bonus to Reflex Defense increases by 1. \nBIOTECH DEVICE TRAIT: \nAdd Device to Creature: Alter a bioengineered creature to accept a biotech or standard technological enhancement such as a miniaturized sensor pack. \nEnhanced Strength: Increase the device's Strength score by 2. \nImproved Durability: The device's damage reduction increases by 1, and it gains extra hit points equal to one-quarter of its maximum hit points. \nMastercraft Device: Skill checks made using the device gain a +1 equipment bonus, or the device's existing equipment bonus increases by 1. \nBIOTECH VEHICLE TRAIT: \nDovin Basal Enhancement: Increase the effects of a dovin basal to grant one of the following benefits to a starship:  +1 additional square of movement at starship scale, +2 SR, or +1 die of damage when using a dovin basal. \nEnhanced Dexterity: Increase the vehicle's Dexterity score by 2. \nImproved Speed: Increases the vehicle speed by one-quarter of its base speed (minimum 1 square) \nBIOTECH WEAPON TRAIT:\nImproved Accuracy: The weapon gains a +1 equipment bonus on attack rolls. \nImproved Damage: The weapon deals +2 points of damage on a successful hit. If the weapon has a damage multiplier (for example, 6d10x2), apply the extra damage before applying the multiplier. \nSelective Fire: An autofire-only ranged weapon can be set to fire single shots, or a single-shot ranged weapon that doesn't have a burst radius can be made to have an autofire mode. \nSpecial: Nobles and scoundrels may add this feat to their class list of bonus feats. This feat allows you to make Treat Injury checks on biotechnology without the -5 penalty."

Normal: Autofire uses ten shots, targets a 2-square-by-2-square area, and can't be aimed at a specific target. Without this feat, if you attempt an autofire attack at a specific target, it simply counts as a normal attack and all the extra shots are wasted. SSotG: Vehicle weapons capable of autofire can be used with this feat normally. This is, in fact, the only time autofire attacks are useful in starship-scale combat."

The non-lightsaber end of the pike deals 1d6 damage. If you have the Dual Weapon Mastery 1 feat, the penalty is reduced to 0. Reasons: First off, the feat is a character feat. Character feats are rare and precious, especially for jedi, since they need them to take Force Training. That\u2019s also why I don\u2019t really want any prerequisites for the feat. Secondly, as noted, an extra 1d6 damage is not that much, that\u2019s why I made the penalty -2 instead of -5 (or the original -10). It\u2019s not overpowering. It\u2019s pretty balanced.]]"

Other characters trained in the Mechanics skill may use the aid another action to assist your Mechanics check; if any assisting character also has the Starship Designer feat, divide the starship's cost by the number of characters who have this feat (including the primary designer) when determining the time required. When making modifications to starships, you never treat the work as if though it were a nonstandard modification, even if it normally would be (see Nonstandard Modifications, SotG page 39). Additionally, you can make custom modifications to starships. Each of these modifications has a base cost of 5,000 credits (multiplied by the star-ship size cost modifier given on SotG page 38) and requires a DC 25 Mechanics check. On a failed check, the modification fails; you must spend half again as much time and money to make a second attempt, and you gain a +2 bonus on your Mechanics check for each attempt after the first. Installation of a custom modification normally takes one day per 5,000 credits of final cost. The same system can be customized multiple times, but doing so becomes increasingly difficult and expensive. For every previous custom modification on a given system, increase the DC by 5 and the base cost by 10,000 credits. No system can be customized more than three times. Multiple benefits from successive customizations stack. Typical customizations are described below. The Gamemaster may allow other modifications.\n\u2022Add Emplacement: You add 1 unused emplacement point to a starship. \n\u2022Improve Hull: You add a number of hit points to a starship equal to 1/2 its Strength score (rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10). \n\u2022Improve Hyperdrive: You can reengineer a hyperdrive to improve its class by 1 step (x2 to x1, x1 to x.75, and so on). The hyperdrive obeys all the restrictions of its new class. (This is the primary way that class .75 and class .5 hyperdrives come into existence.)\n\u2022Improve Shields: The SR of the shields is increased by 5.\n\u2022Improve Weapons: You can grant one weapon a +1 equipment bonus on attack rolls.\nSee SotG Chapter 3 for more information on designing and modifying starships."

These traits replace the traits granted by the Tech Specialist feat. You may still use the Tech Specialist options if you so choose. You must pay one-fifth the cost of the device, armor, weapon, droid, or vehicle you wish to modify or 2,000 credits, whichever is more, before beginning the modification. This fee replaces the normal cost of modification from the Tech Specialist feat. Completing the modification requires 1 day per 1,000 credits of the modification's cost. At the end of this time, make a DC 30 Mechanics check; you cannot take 10 or take 20 on this check. If the check succeeds, the modification is completed successfully, and the object gains the desired trait. If the check fails, you lose all credits spent making the modification, and the object does not gain the desired trait. However, you can start over from scratch if you wish. Only characters with the Tech Specialist feat can assist you, reducing proportionately the time needed to complete the modification. At the end of modification process, they can make a Mechanics check to aid your check. The market value of a modified item is equal to the base cost of the item plus double the cost of the modifications made to it (not including credits wasted on failed modification attempts). Special: You may select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different set of traits (armor, devices, droids, vehicles, or weapons).\n\u2022Mobile Armor (armor): Increase the armor\u2019s speed by 1 square (medium and heavy armors only). \n\u2022Reinforced Armor (armor): The armor grants damage reduction 2. \n\u2022Superior Agile Armor (armor): Increase the armor\u2019s maximum Dexterity bonus by 2. \n\u2022Superior Fortifying Armor (armor): Increase the armor\u2019s equipment bonus to Fortitude Defense by 2. \n\u2022Superior Helmet Package (armor): The armor grants a +5 equipment bonus on Perception checks. \n\u2022Superior Protective Armor (armor): Increase the armor\u2019s armor bonus to Reflex Defense by 2. \n\u2022Superior Durability (device): Increase the device\u2019s DR by 2 and its hit points by 150%. [[Unofficial errata: should be 50%, not 150%. This would follow the logical progression from Tech Specialist]]\n\u2022Reinforced Device (device): The device's break DC increases by 5.\n\u2022Superior Mastercraft (device): Skill checks made using the device gain a +2 equipment bonus, or any existing equipment bonus increases by 2. \n\u2022Superior Strength (device): Increase the device\u2019s Strength score by 4. \n\u2022Superior Upgrade (device): The device gains two additional upgrade slots. \n\u2022Ion Dispersal Coating (droid): The droid gains DR 5 against ion damage. \n\u2022Superior Ability (droid): Increase the droid\u2019s Dexterity, Intelligence or Strength by 4. \n\u2022Superior Ability (vehicle): Increase the vehicle\u2019s Dexterity score by 4 or its Strength score by 2. \n\u2022Superior Sensors (vehicle): Increase the vehicle\u2019s Perception modifier by 2. \n\u2022Superior Shields (vehicle): Increase the vehicle\u2019s SR by 10. \n\u2022Superior Speed (vehicle): Increase the vehicle\u2019s speed by one-third of its base speed (minimum 1 square). \n\u2022Superior Accuracy (weapon): The weapon gains a +2 equipment bonus on attack rolls. \n\u2022Superior Capacity (weapon): The weapon\u2019s power pack provides double the normal number of shots. \n\u2022Superior Damage (weapon): The weapon deals +5 damage. If the weapon has a damage multiplier, apply the extra damage before applying the multiplier. \n\u2022Superior Range (Weapon): The weapon\u2019s ranges all increase by 50%. \n*S&V 48: Device Traits: Weapons, armor, and vehicles are also devices, so they are eligible for all of these modifications. (Droids are characters, not devices.) In addition to the listed modifications, it is possible to install an additional upgrade slot on any device using the Tech Specialist feat. This modification can be made only once. \nDroid Traits: Any equipment with the droidification upgrade (page 40) or weapon with the autonomous upgrade (page 42) is technically a droid, so it is eligible for these modifications. \nArmor Traits : If a device or vehicle has an armor bonus to its Reflex Defense (either normally or because of an upgrade). it can benefit from the protective armor modification. \n*optional: you can consider increasing the license value for this upgrade, causing the buyer the need to acquire a new license."

You may perform only one modification at a time. Unless noted otherwise, you cannot grant more than one benefit to a single device, suit of armor, weapon, droid, or vehicle, and you cannot apply the same benefit more than once. Before beginning the modification, you must pay one-tenth the cost of the device, suit of armor, weapon, droid, or vehicle you wish to modify or 1,000 credits, whichever is more. Completing the modification requires 1 day per 1,000 credits of the modification's cost. At the end of this time, make a DC 20 Mechanics check; you can't take 10 or take 20 on this check. If the check succeeds, the modification is completed successfully, and the object gains the desired trait. If the check fails, you lose all credits spent making the modification, and the object doesn't gain the desired trait. However, you may start over if you wish. Other characters trained in the Mechanics skill can assist you, reducing proportionately the time needed to complete the modification. At the end of the modification process, they can make a Mechanics check to aid your check. The market value of a modified item is equal to the base cost of the item + double the cost of the modifications made to it (not including credits wasted on failed modification attempts). \n\u2022Agile Armor (armor*): Increase the armor\u2019s maximum Dexterity bonus by 1. \n\u2022Fortifying Armor (armor*): Increase the armor\u2019s equipment bonus to Fortitude Defense by 1. \n\u2022Protective Armor (armor*): Increase the armor\u2019s armor bonus to Reflex Defense by 1. \n\u2022Additional Upgrade (device*): The device gains an additional upgrade slot. \n\u2022Enhanced Strength (device*): Increase the device\u2019s Strength score by 2. \n\u2022Improved Durability (device*): The device's damage reduction increases by 1, and it gains extra hit points equal to one-quarter of its maximum hit points.\n\u2022Mastercraft Device (device*): Skill checks made using the device gain a +1 equipment bonus, or the device's existing equipment bonus increases by 1.\n\u2022Enhanced Ability (droid*): Increase the droid\u2019s Dexterity, Intelligence or Strength by 2. \n\u2022Enhanced Intelligence (droid*): Increase the droid's Intelligence score by 2.\n\u2022Enhanced Strength (droid*): Increase the droid's Strength score by 2.\n\u2022Enhanced Dexterity (vehicle): Increase the vehicle\u2019s Dexterity score by 2. \n\u2022Improved Speed (vehicle): Increase the vehicle\u2019s speed by one-quarter of its base speed (minimum 1 square). \n\u2022Improved Shields (vehicle): Increase the vehicle\u2019s SR by 5. \n\u2022Improved Accuracy (weapon): The weapon gains a +1 equipment bonus on attack rolls. \n\u2022Improved Damage (weapon): The weapon deals +2 points of damage with a successful hit. If the weapon has a damage multiplier (for example, 6d10x2), apply the extra damage before applying the multiplier.\n\u2022Selective Fire (Weapon): An autofire-only ranged weapon can be set to fire single shots, or a single-shot ranged weapon can be made to have an autofire mode. It is still treated as an autofire-only weapon for purposes of bracing (Not allowed for weapons that have a burst radius or splash radius.)\n*S&V 48: Device Traits: Weapons, armor, and vehicles are also devices, so they are eligible for all of these modifications. (Droids are characters, not devices.) In addition to the listed modifications, it is possible to install an additional upgrade slot on any device using the Tech Specialist feat. This modification can be made only once. \nAccording to the devs, you may add an upgrade slot to advanced cybernetics using Tech Specialist or Increase Size (S&V). You may use TS's device traits on advanced cybernetics.\nDroid Traits: Any equipment with the droidification upgrade (page 40) or weapon with the autonomous upgrade (page 42) is technically a droid, so it is eligible for these modifications. \nArmor Traits : If a device or vehicle has an armor bonus to its Reflex Defense (either normally or because of an upgrade). it can benefit from the protective armor modification."

You can move up to twice your speed (minimum 2 squares) in a straight line through obstructed or unobstructed terrain, and then take a full attack action as a part of this standard action instead of a full-round action.

Special: Bonuses and penalties from other feats and talents stack with this ability. You can attack each target only once. You must have enough ammunition for each target; otherwise you stop dealing damage when you run out. Aiming provides no benefit on this attack.\nUnleashed Rage: By spending a Destiny Point at the start of your rage, you gain an additional + 10 to your melee attack rolls and melee damage rolls and +5 to your Fortitude Defense. At the end of your rage, you move -2 persistent steps along the condition track. The penalties imposed by this condition persist until you take at least 20 minutes to recuperate, during which time you can\u2019t engage in any strenuous activity.
