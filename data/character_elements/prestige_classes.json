A veteran of countless engagements, the ace pilot has proven her skill again and again by virtue of facing the enemy and surviving—and making sure the enemy did not. She has several kills to her credit, and her combat maneuvers are occasionally studied and discussed in training academies for their ingenuity and effectiveness. [Sourced from CRB p.206]",
