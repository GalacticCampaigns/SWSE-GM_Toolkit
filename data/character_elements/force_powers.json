I think it should likewise take a minute to repair a Drained lightsaber as it does to repair a \"shorted\" lightsaber. \nIf you \"Drain\" a blaster, the target can just \"reload\" another power pack and make it work again. There's nothing in the rules that disallows reloading a lightsaber. But I can't find anything in the rules that allows it either. It's not like it has an easy-to-replace power pack like a blaster weapon. I've looked at the inner-workings of a lightsaber and there doesn't seem to be any easy way of replacing the energy cell. The energy cell seems well integrated into the weapon. Perhaps a GM would allow you to use the Repair Object application of the Mechanics skill, but this normally takes 1 hour.]]",

The whirlwind lifts them about a half meter off of the ground, spinning them in the air and buffeting them with Force energy. Time: Standard action.\nTarget: One creature within 12 squares and within line of sight.\nMake a Use the Force check. The result of the check determines the effect, if any.\nCompare the result to the target's Fortitude Defense. If the check result equals or exceeds the target's Fortitude Defense, the target is captured within the whirlwind and immobilized until the beginning of your next turn. Any attack rolls or skill checks the target attempts while within the whirlwind are at a -5 penalty. The target falls prone when the effect ends. The target also sustains damage at the end of your turn as determined by the results of your Use the Force check.\nDC 15: The target takes 1d6 points of Force damage.\nDC 20: The target takes 2d6 points of Force damage.\nDC 25: The target takes 3d6 points of Force damage.\nDC 30: The target takes 4d6 points of Force damage.\nThe target adds a size modifier to its Fortitude Defense: Colossal, +50; Gargantuan, +20; Huge, +10; Large, +5; Medium and smaller, +0.\nSpecial: You can spend a Force Point to increase the penalty to the target's attack rolls and skill checks from -5 to -10.\nYou can maintain Force whirlwind from round to round, extending the normal duration. Maintaining the Force whirlwind power is a move action, and you must make a new Use the Force check each round. If you take damage while maintaining a Force whirlwind, you must succeed on a Use the Force check (DC = 15 + damage taken) to continue maintaining the power. If a target within a Force whirlwind is attacked or otherwise damaged or moved down the condition track by you or one of your allies, the effects of Force whirlwind end immediately.\n[[Personal note:: When a creature is immobilized it cannot move by its own volition. An immobilized creature can take move actions, but it cannot move from its current space, (It also can perform swift or standard actions) but it cannot move from its current space, and it cannot make skill checks associated with movement (such as Acrobatics, Climb, Jump, or Swim). An immobilized creature can still be moved by other effects, such as being the target of a Bantha Rush or the Force Thrust power.]]",

Target: One character or object within 12 squares and within your line of sight.\nMake a Use the Force check. The result of the check determines the maximum size of the target you can lift (see below). If the target is a creature that resists your attempt, your Use the Force check must also exceed the target’s Will Defense. You can hurl the target at (or drop it on) another target in range if your Use the Force check exceeds the second target’s Reflex Defense. Both targets take damage determined by your Use the Force check result.\nDC 15: Move object up to Medium size (deals 2d6 points of damage)\nDC 20: Move object up to Large size (deals 4d6 points of damage)\nDC 25: Move object up to Huge size (deals 6d6 points of damage)\nDC 30: Move object up to Gargantuan size (deals 8d6 points of damage)\nDC 35: Move object up to Colossal size (deals 10d6 points of damage) \nSpecial: You may maintain your concentration on the targeted object to continue to move it from round to round. Maintaining the move object power is a standard action, and you must make a new Use the Force check each round. If you suffer damage while maintaining move object, you must succeed on a Use the Force check (DC = 15 + damage taken) to continue concentrating. If you deal damage with the move object power, you cease to be able to maintain it.\nIf you use move object against a hovering or flying target (such as a speeder or starship), the target can oppose your Use the Force check with a grapple check as a reaction. If the target wins the opposed check, you are unable to move the target.\nYou may spend a Force Point to increase the maximum size of the object by one category and deal an additional 2d6 points of damage (maximum size Colossal [frigate], 12d6 damage). Alternatively, you may spend a Destiny Point (see page 112) to increase the maximum size of the object by three categories and deal an additional 6d6 points of damage (maximum size Colossal [station], 16d6 damage). \nOfficial clarification: You cannot use the Move Object to \"fly\" yourself around. You need Force Flight for that. You also cannot fly by holding on to an object targeted by the Move Object power. The buddy system doesn't work either. A friend may use Move Object to lift you off the ground, but he cannot do so if he is being flown via Move Object himself by another (such as by you).\n[[House rule for forcing open doors: Your Move Object check must beat the Break DC of the door (see Core page 151). This means you still need to beat a high DC of 45 to open a blast door.]]\nUnleashed: When you hurl one object or character into another object or character and you spend a Destiny Point, multiply the damage dealt by 2.\n[[Anti-pinata house rule: “If a target within a Move Object is attacked or otherwise damaged or moved down the condition track by you or one of your allies, the effects of Move Object end immediately.”]]",

Target: All adjacent targets.\nMake a Use the Force check: The targets make Strength checks, adding their base attack bonus. If you beat the target's Strength check, you push it back 1 square plus 1 additional square for every 5 points by which you exceed the target's Strength check result. If you push the target into a larger object, the target takes 1d6 points of damage.\nThe target adds a size modifier to its Strength check: Colossal, +50; Gargantuan, +20; Huge, +10; Large, +5; Medium, +0; Small, -5; Tiny, -10; Diminutive, -15; Fine, -20. In addition, it gets a +5 stability bonus if it has more than 2 legs or is otherwise exceptionally stable.\nSpecial: You can spend a Force Point to apply a -5 penalty to the target's Strength check to resist your repulse. Additionally, after spending a Force Point, if you successfully push the target into a larger object, you deal an extra 2d6 points of damage from the extreme force of the thrust.\nUnleashed: When you use the repulse power and you spend a Destiny Point, opponents affected by the power do not add their size modifier to their Strength checks to resist the power's effect. A creature that would normally have a penalty on its Strength check due to size still retains that penalty.\nAdditionally, the distance you move the target is multiplied by 2. If you push the target into a larger object, the target takes 1d6 points of damage per square moved by this power.",
