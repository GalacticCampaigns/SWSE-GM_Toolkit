(The Influential Friends talent grants a noble an automatic high skill check result that is the result of calling in favors from some well-connected allies. Some Gamemasters might wonder what the talent really represents. In essence, when a noble uses this talent, he calls in a favor from a contact, who sends a representative who has that skill (or just conveys the result of the skill check) to the heroes. For example, if the heroes need information on a crime lord but have no one trained in Gather Information, the noble uses this talent, and his contacts supply the heroes with the information from the resulting Gather Information check. Likewise, if the heroes need to get past a security checkpoint in a very important mission, the noble calls upon his influential friends to have a Deception check made to provide the heroes with high-quality fake identification and paperwork. The heroes must have access to planetary or interplanetary communications systems to use the talent.)"

You must spend a Force Point when you activate the power to do this, and the area you target is based on the size of the object: Large, 2x2; Huge, 3x3; Gargantuan, 4x4; Colossal and larger, 6x6. When you use move object to make an area attack with the object you are moving, you compare your Use the Force check to the Reflex Defense of each creature, droid, and vehicle in the target area. If your check equals or exceeds the target\u2019s Reflex Defense, it takes damage from the object (as determined by the move object power). Otherwise, the target takes half damage.

Instead of dealing full damage, you instead deal half damage to your target and move it -1 step on the condition track (see Conditions, page 148). In addition, you sever one of your target's arms at the wrist or elbow joint, or one of the target's legs at the knee or ankle joint (your choice). Severing part of an arm prevents the target from wielding weapons or using tools in that hand and imposes a -5 penalty on skill checks and ability checks keyed to Strength and Dexterity. Severing part of a leg knocks the target prone, reduces the target's speed by half, reduces its carrying capacity by half, and imposes a -5 penalty on skill checks and ability checks keyed to Strength and Dexterity. Because of the severity of such an injury, losing a part of a limb causes a persistent condition that can only be removed by having surgery successfully performed on you (see Treat Injury skill, page 74). A cybernetic replacement limb (see page 137) negates these reductions and penalties."
