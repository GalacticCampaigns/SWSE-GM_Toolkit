A successful hit deals 3d6 points of sonic damage; if the attack misses, the target takes half damage instead. Each use of this ability moves the Ithorian -1 step along the condition track (see Conditions, page 148). An Ithorian can choose to add more dice (d6s) to the damage it deals with its bellow, but each additional 1d6 of damage moves the Ithorian another-1 step along the condition track.
