I think it should likewise take a minute to repair a Drained lightsaber as it does to repair a \"shorted\" lightsaber. \nIf you \"Drain\" a blaster, the target can just \"reload\" another power pack and make it work again. There's nothing in the rules that disallows reloading a lightsaber. But I can't find anything in the rules that allows it either. It's not like it has an easy-to-replace power pack like a blaster weapon. I've looked at the inner-workings of a lightsaber and there doesn't seem to be any easy way of replacing the energy cell. The energy cell seems well integrated into the weapon. Perhaps a GM would allow you to use the Repair Object application of the Mechanics skill, but this normally takes 1 hour.]]",

Target: One Intelligence 3 or higher creature in line of sight and within 12 squares of you.\nMake a Use the Force check. If you equal or exceed the target\u2019s Will Defense, you may choose one of the following effects:\n\u2014You create a fleeting hallucination that distracts the target and enables you to use the Stealth skill even if the target is aware of you.\n\u2014You perform a feint so that the next attack you make against the target ignores its Dexterity bonus to Reflex Defense (if any).\n\u2014You make an otherwise unpalatable suggestion seem completely reasonable to the target. You must be able to communicate with the target, and the suggestion can\u2019t obviously threaten the target\u2019s life. The target won\u2019t realize later that what he did is unacceptable. Official Clarification: Mind Trick makes an unpalatable suggestion seem reasonable -- it does NOT mean that the person will automatically do what you want. A Persuasion check may still be called for if even the reasonable suggestion seems like something the target may not do. Mind Tricking the stormtrooper leader into thinking you are an ally may work, depending on the situation. In the middle of a firefight, it might distract him for one round, but then he's going to realize that his buddies are shooting at you and figure it out pretty quick.\n\u2014You fill the target with terror, causing it to flee from you at top speed for 1 minute. The affected creature stops fleeing if it is wounded. The effect is negated if the target\u2019s level is equal to or higher than your character level. This is a fear effect.\nSpecial: If you are making a suggestion, you may spend a Force Point to improve the target\u2019s attitude by one step, plus one additional step for every 5 points by which your Use the Force check exceeds the target\u2019s Will Defense.",

You need Force Flight for that. You also cannot fly by holding on to an object targeted by the Move Object power. The buddy system doesn't work either.
