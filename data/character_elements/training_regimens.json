Then you roll the ball slowly up the side of the bowl, keeping it in contact with the bowl at all times, until it reaches the upper rim. The orb is then held in place for 5 minutes, and must remain perfectly still. You then roll the orb slowly back to the bottom of the bowl, moving it with the Force and not allowing the orb to move under gravity's power. Time: 1 hour. Target: You. Requirements: A deep bowl and a polished stone orb.\nMake a Use the Force check. The result of the check determines the benefits of the regimen:\nDC 18: You let the bowl move during the regimen. You gain 1 temporary Force Point which you can apply only to a Use the Force check to activate a power with the [telekinetic] descriptor.\nDC 23: You let the orb roll under gravity's power back to its starting position. You gain 2 temporary Force Points which you can apply only to Use the Force checks to activate powers with the [telekinetic] descriptor.\nDC 28: You complete the regimen perfectly.

It begins by setting up 360 wax cylinders at 1-degree intervals around your body, each one approximately 1.5 meters away. No ball bearings are required for this cadence. You must strike the cylinders according to a complex mathematical formula. By the time the cadence is completed, you will have learned to perform incredibly taxing mental tasks while also focusing on the external chaos of combat. Time: 3 hours. Target: You. Requirements: Lightsaber and 360 wax cylinders.\nMake a Use the Force check. You take a penalty on your Use the Force check equal to your Dark Side Score. The result of the check determines the benefits of the regimen:\nDC 26: You make a mistake during the first hour. You gain a +1 Force bonus on Use the Force checks made to continue maintaining a Force power whenever you take damage.\nDC 32: You make a mistake during the second hour. You gain a +2 Force bonus on Use the Force checks made to continue maintaining a Force power whenever you take damage.\nDC 38: You make no mistakes during the regimen. You gain a +2 Force bonus on Use the Force checks made to continue maintaining a Force power whenever you take damage, and if you are damaged while maintaining a Force power, you can spend a Force Point as a reaction to not have to make a new Use the Force check."

You take a penalty on your Use the Force check equal to your Dark Side Score. The result of the check determines the benefits of the regimen:\nDC 31: You make a mistake during the first hour.

You gain a +2 bonus on Use the Force checks made to use the Move Light Object application of the skill.\nDC 43: You complete the cadence without making a single mistake. You gain a +2 bonus on Use the Force checks made to use the Move Light Object application of the skill, and you add the Kinetic Combat Force power (see page 51 of the Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide) to your Force suite. Additionally, you can spend a Force Point to reroll any Use the Force check made to activate a Force power with the [telekinetic] descriptor, keeping the better result."
