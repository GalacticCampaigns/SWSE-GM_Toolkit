J,10,Eyes of the Force,"This regimen trains you to sense images that you cannot normally see by reading the surface thoughts of others. During this regimen, an assistant holds a two-dimensional image viewer so that you see the images being displayed on the screen. As the image viewer cycles through different images of common objects, you must read the surface thoughts of the assistant to determine what image is being displayed on the screen at that time. Time: 1 hour. Target: You. Requirements: A two-dimensional image display and an assistant

Make a Use the Force check. The result of the check determines the benefits of the regimen:

DC 13: You successfully read one-third of the assistant's surface thoughts. You gain a +1 Force bonus on Use the Force checks made to use the Telepathy application of the Use the Force skill.

DC 18: You successfully read two-thirds of the assistant's surface thoughts. You gain a +2 Force bonus on Use the Force checks made to use the Telepathy application of the Use the Force skill.

DC18: +2 Use the Force with Telepathy
DC23: +2 Use the Force with Telepathy & against unwilling can sense surface emotions & stray thoughts"
J,11,Oxygen Bottle,"This difficult regimen trains you to master environmental manipulation through the Force. You must first empty a glass bottle of air, creating a perfect vacuum inside. Then you must allow only oxygen to slip past the seal created by the Force, eventually filling the bottle with pure oxygen before placing the vac-seal stopper. This regimen requires you to use the Force in a nearly molecular level, as well as the Sense aspect of the Force to determine what molecules are making their way into the bottle. Time: 1 hour. Target: You. Requirements: A glass bottle with a vac-seal stopper

Make a Use the Force check. The result of the check determines the benefits of the regimen:

DC 26: You fail to create a vacuum in the bottle before the regimen begins, resulting in an imperfect mixture. You gain a +2 Force bonus to your Fortitude Defense against inhaled poisons and non-corrosive atmospheric hazards.

DC 32: You create a vacuum in the bottle, but let other molecules enter through your Force seal, creating an imperfect mixture. You gain a +5 Force bonus to your Fortitude Defense against inhaled poisons and non-corrosive atmospheric hazards.

DC 38: You complete this regimen perfectly, resulting in a bottle full of nothing but pure oxygen. You become immune to inhaled poisons and non-corrosive atmospheric hazards.
",1 hr,you,,"DC13: +2 Fort Def v. inhaled poisons & non-corrosive atmosphere
DC18: +5 Fort Def v. inhaled poisons & non-corrosive atmosphere
DC23: immune v. inhaled poisons & non-corrosive atmosphere"
J,11,Quiet the Mind,"This regimen trains you to block out distractions and stray thoughts. It requires little more than finding a quiet, secluded spot and slipping into a meditative trance to clear your mind of doubt, questions, fear, and the chaos of the galaxy. Jedi use this technique to open themselves to the flow of the Force, allowing them to see distant places and events. Time: 1 hour. Target: You.

Make a Use the Force check. The result of the check determines the benefits of the regimen:

DC 13: You meditate, but your mind is still clouded by external stimuli. You can add one use of the farseeing power to your Force suite, but once it is used, it cannot be regained by any means.

DC 18: You meditate, quieting your mind except for but a few small distractions. You can add one use of the farseeing power to your Force suite.

DC 23: You meditate, quieting your mind entirely. You can add one use of the farseeing power to your Force suite, and you gain the benefits of the Visions talent (if you do not already know it).

DC18: +1 farseeing 
DC23: +1 farseeing & gain benefit of Visions"
J,11,Sparring Practice,"This simple regimen allows you to practice against another living opponent, simulating one-on-one combat. During sparring practice, each combatant attempts to strike the other while exercising restraint and control. If you use a training lightsaber (see page 56), you can spar without fear of harming your opponent. Time: 2 hours. Target: You. Requirements: Lightsaber (or training lightsaber) and a sparring partner.

Make a Use the Force check. The result of the check determines the benefits of the regimen:

J,11,Telekinetic Practice,"This regimen hones your skill with the Alter aspect of the Force and enhances telekinetic precision. You begin by placing a deep bowl on the ground, with an orb at the bottom of the bowl. First, you must use the Force to hold the bowl perfectly still and pin it to the ground. Then you roll the ball slowly up the side of the bowl, keeping it in contact with the bowl at all times, until it reaches the upper rim. The orb is then held in place for 5 minutes, and must remain perfectly still. You then roll the orb slowly back to the bottom of the bowl, moving it with the Force and not allowing the orb to move under gravity's power. Time: 1 hour. Target: You. Requirements: A deep bowl and a polished stone orb.

Make a Use the Force check. The result of the check determines the benefits of the regimen:

This Force regimen is performed blind, often with the help of a helmet equipped with an opaque blast shield. Time: 1 hour. Target: You. Requirements: Lightsaber, training remote, and a helmet with a blast shield.

Make a Use the Force check. The result of the check determines the benefits of the regimen:

J,12,Vo'Ren's 1st Cadence,"Vo’ren's first cadence teaches precision through control of one's body and sensory awareness. You set up 19 wax cylinders at 10-degree intervals around your body, each one approximately 1.5 meters away, forming a semicircle. Atop each cylinder, one metal ball bearing is placed. You must then use your lightsaber to strike each ball bearing without making contact with the wax cylinder beneath it. You must place the cylinders and ball bearings one at a time until all 19 have been placed. Time: 1 hour. Target: You. Requirements: Lightsaber, 19 wax cylinders, and 190 ball bearings.

You must set up 72 wax cylinders at 5-degree intervals around your body, each one approximately 1.5 meters away. Atop each cylinder, one metal ball bearing is placed. Like in the first cadence, you must place the cylinders and ball bearings one at a time until all 72 have been placed. However, unlike the first cadence, you must strike at all of the cylinders in a full 360-degree arc without turning your body to face the cylinders to the rear, honing your ability to strike at enemies coming from all sides. Time: 2 hours. Target: You. Requirement: Lightsaber, 72 wax cylinders, and 2,701 ball bearings

J,13,Vo'Ren's 3rd Cadence,"Vo'ren's third cadence teaches precision through control of one's body and sensory awareness. You set up 180 wax cylinders at 2-degree intervals around your body, each one approximately 1.5 meters away. Atop each cylinder, one metal ball bearing is placed. Unlike the second cadence, in the third cadence you must strike every fifth ball bearing, making a rotation around your body several times over the course of the regimen. This prepares you for irregular attack patterns from all sides. Time: 3 hours. Target: You. Requirements: Lightsaber, 180 wax cylinders, and 16,290 ball bearings

J,13,Vo'Ren's 4th Cadence,"Vo'ren's fourth cadence teaches composure and quick thinking amid the chaos of battle. It begins by setting up 360 wax cylinders at 1-degree intervals around your body, each one approximately 1.5 meters away. No ball bearings are required for this cadence. You must strike the cylinders according to a complex mathematical formula. By the time the cadence is completed, you will have learned to perform incredibly taxing mental tasks while also focusing on the external chaos of combat. Time: 3 hours. Target: You. Requirements: Lightsaber and 360 wax cylinders.

Make a Use the Force check. You take a penalty on your Use the Force check equal to your Dark Side Score. The result of the check determines the benefits of the regimen:

J,13,Vo'Ren's 5th Cadence,"In Vo'ren's fifth and final cadence, you must demonstrate true mastery over yourself and your lightsaber. No wax cylinders are required; you simply know when you have made a correct strike. Unlike the other cadences, this regimen requires you to use the Force to manipulate your lightsaber, an act of pure telekinetic power in which your hands never touch the weapon. This technique brings together the Control, Sense, and Alter aspects of the Force into one training regimen. Time: 3 hours. Target: You. Requirement: Lightsaber.

Make a Use the Force check. You take a penalty on your Use the Force check equal to your Dark Side Score. The result of the check determines the benefits of the regimen:
