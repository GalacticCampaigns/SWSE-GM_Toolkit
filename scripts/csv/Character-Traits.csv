Sharing a memory begins with taking a full-round action to initiate the link between two adjacent Caamasi; transferring a memory requires as much time as the events being recalled. The recipient of a memory must be willing to receive it. Experiencing memniiis not like receiving a photographic memory of those events, but rather a complete, immersive experience.

CR,187,Droid,Behavioral Inhibitors,"Droids (except 4th-degree droids) cannot intentionally harm a sentient living being or knowingly allow a sentient living being to be harmed. Furthermore, all droids must follow orders given to them by their rightful owners, as long as those orders don't require the droid to harm a sentient living being. Droids with heuristic processors can sometimes violate these restrictions by creatively interpreting their behavioral inhibitions (see Processors, page 190)."
CR,187,Droid,Ion Damage Vulnerability,"As electronic constructs, droids are vulnerable to damage from ion weapons (see Ion Weapons, page 159). Generally, ion weapons have the same effect on droids that stun weapons have on living beings."
CR,187,Droid,Maintenance,"Droids do not sleep, eat, or breathe. However, they do need to enter shutdown mode and recharge for 1 hour after 100 hours of operation. If a droid fails to do so, it must make an Endurance check each hour (DC 10, + 1 per additional hour after the first) or move -1 persistent step along the condition track (see Conditions, page 148). This persistent condition can only be removed by the droid recharging for 1 hour."
CR,188,Droid,Repair,"Droids can regain lost hit points only through the use of the Mechanics skill (see page 68). A droid can use this skill to repair itself, but it takes a -5 penalty on its skill check."
CR,188,Droid,Shut Down,"A droid that is shut down can take no actions and is effectively unconscious. Shutting down a willing droid is a standard action. Shutting down an unwilling droid is more difficult, requiring that you to grab the droid (see Grab, page 152) and then make a Mechanics check (DC = droid's Will Defense) as a standard action while it's grabbed. You cannot shut down an unwilling droid with locked access unless it is disabled or otherwise helpless (see Locked Access, page 195)."
CR,188,Droid,Skills,"Droids normally cannot use any skill untrained except for Acrobatics, Climb, Jump, and Perception. A droid with a heuristic processor ignores this limitation (see Processors, page 190)."
CR,188,Droid,Systems,"Droids can have many of their characteristics changed by installing or replacing existing systems (see Modifying Droids, page 197)."
CR,188,Droid,Nonliving,"A droid is immune to poison, disease, radiation, noncorrosive atmospheric hazards, vacuum, mind-affecting effects, stunning effects, and any other effect that works only on living targets. Droids have no connection to the Force and can't gain the Force Sensitivity feat or learn Force powers. Droids do not have a Constitution score, so they don't get bonus hit points for having a high Constitution, and they apply their Strength modifier to their Fortitude Defense. Unlike living beings, droids don't ""die,"" but they can be disabled or destroyed. If a droid is reduced to 0 hit points, it is disabled and cannot be reactivated until it is repaired so that has at least 1 hit point. If the attack that reduced the droid to 0 hit points also exceeds the droid's damage threshold, the droid is destroyed instead. A destroyed droid cannot be repaired or salvaged."
