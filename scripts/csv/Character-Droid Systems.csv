SGD,55,Antitheft comlink locator,"Some droids are equipped with internal comlinks to broadcast messages. However, these devices require the droid to speak out loud, and in some situations such an act is inadvisable. A droid equipped with an antitheft comlink locator can send a distress signal to its master's com link with no apparent activity by the droid. The distress signal broadcasts no information, but it can it be tracked. The signal continues to broadcast if the droid is deactivated, but it shuts down if the droid is destroyed.

SGD,55,Audio enhancers,"Audio enhancers increase the sensitivity of a droid's aural sensors, enabling it to pick up sounds not normally perceived by standard sensors. When eavesdropping or listening for distant and ambient sounds, a droid equipped with audio enhancers can reroll Perception checks, taking the better of the two results. All other modifiers for the Perception check still apply.

SGD,55,Audio-Radial Stunner,"This defense system protects droids in dangerous situations. As a standard action, the audio-radial stunner broadcasts a short-ranged, high-pitched frequency on all channels, calling attention to the droid and stunning any nearby creatures. Until the end of the droid's next turn, any creature that starts its turn adjacent to the droid must make a DC 20 Endurance check. Failure causes the creature to move -1 step on the condition track. The stunner shuts down if the droid is deactivated or destroyed.

SGD,55,Automap,"An automap system actively scans the area within a 12-square radius of a droid in which it is installed. The scan reveals terrain, atmospheric conditions, electromagnetic signatures, and lifeforms. However, an automap scan cannot penetrate solid objects such as walls and closed doors. The scan also includes navigational information, such as the droid's direction and speed when readings were taken as well as global coordinates if the droid can establish a link to an orbiting satellite or starship.

CR,191,Backup Processor,"Backup Processor: A droid with a remote receiver can also have a backup processor that allows the droid to function even if it loses contact with its remote processor. The droid will continue executing its last received orders until contact is reestablished.

",Processors,100,-,-,Allows a remote drone to function like a droid when losing contact with processor
CR,190,Basic Processor,"Basic Processor: Basic processors are not designed for creative thought and problem solving, and as such most droids interpret instructions and behavioral inhibitions very literally. Furthermore, basic processors are very limited in that the droid cannot perform any task for which it was not programmed. For example, a droid that is not trained in the Deception skill cannot lie or otherwise convey false or unknown information. A droid with a basic processor cannot use any skill untrained except for Acrobatics, Climb, Jump, and Perception. Similarly, a basic processor does not allow a droid to use any weapon with which it is not proficient, and a droid's behavioral inhibitors may prevent it from harming sentient living beings altogether (see Behavioral Inhibitors, below). 

Every droid comes with a basic processor, at the very least.

",Processors,-,-,-,No creative thought or problem solving
SGD,63,Battle station,"Droid battle stations provide the functionality of regular droid command stations, and they can be used to direct droids in combat. Droid battle stations are typically large installations, capable of coordinating hundreds or thousands of droids of al l types. Some droid battle stations emulate droid commanders. When the station is installed, select two talents from the droid commander prestige class (see page 28 of this book and pages 42-44 of The Clone Wars Campaign Guide). These talents can be used by the character operating the battle station as if the character has the talents. The number of times each talent can be used is calculated per station, not per character, so switching characters in the middle of a battle does not grant additional uses. Droids with the droid commander prestige class cannot use these talents more often even if they duplicate talents the droid already possesses. 

",Stations,50000 per 100,5000,Military,"select 2 talents from droid commander prestige class, calculated per station not creature, does not duplicate "
CR,191,Behavioral Inhibitors,"Even without a restraining bolt or periodic memory wipes, most droids operate according to a rigid set of guidelines. A droid's core programming-the part of its memory that can't be wiped-provides it with strict instructions on how to react to common circumstances, most of which revolve around obedience, safety, ethics, and morality. These instructions are the droid's behavioral inhibitors.

The most common restriction coded into a droid's memory is the notion that it can't harm a sentient living being or, through inaction, allow a sentient living being to come to harm. (Fourth-degree droids do not have this restriction.) Droids are under similar strictures not to allow themselves to be harmed unless specifically ordered to do so. Of course, droids are also hardwired to obey the commands of their designated masters. When a master's orders conflict with the droid's behavioral inhibitors, the droid is required to inform its master immediately.

",Processors,varies,varies,-,Behavioral Inhibitors include restraining bolt and droid caller
SGD,55,Blaster Recharge Interface,"This hand accessory enables a droid to recharge a standard blaster pack for its master. As a swift action, the droid can plug in and transfer energy to the power pack. Recharging a power pack depletes energy from the droid. For each recharge, the droid loses hit points equal to one of the blaster's damage-dice type. Thus, a droid recharging a power pack for a heavy blaster pistol (3d8) takes 8 points of damage (since the die type is d8).

",Accessory,300,1,Licensed,"as swif action recharge power packs, droid loses hp = dam dice of weapon"
SGD,52,Burrower drive,"Mining and other fifth-degree droids can use a burrower drive to tear through large chunks of ore embedded in the crust of a planet or in an asteroid. A burrower drive enables a droid to move at half speed underground. It can also move vertically up or down at a similar rate.

A burrower drive can be used as a weapon. The droid makes a melee attack. If the attack is successful, the droid deals damage equal to the amount it would do if it had used a self- destruct device. However, each successful attack moves the droid -1 step on the condition track with a persistent condition, as the drill gears and bits strip down and damage the droid.

CR,190,Claw,"Claw: Claws are an intermediate step between tools and hands. They are useful for grabbing onto objects to be moved, but aren't very good for tasks that require fine manipulation. While a droid could easily carry a blaster in its claw, it would have difficulty firing it, for example. A droid using a claw to perform a task that normally requires a true hand must make a DC 15 Dexterity check to succeed at the task. If the check fails, the droid drops the object it is attempting to manipulate.

",Appendage,20xCF,(5xCF),-,"Tasks that requires a hand requires a DC15 DEX roll, if fail it drops the object."
CR,189,Climbing Claws,"Claws designed to grip a surface can be added to any droid with a walking locomotion system. Climbing claws grant the droid a climb speed equal to one-half its walking speed. In addition, a droid equipped with climbing claws may reroll a failed Climb check (keeping the better result) and can take 10 on Climb checks even when rushed or threatened. Climbing claws double the cost of a walking locomotion system.

",Appendage,x2,-,-,"Climb = /2  speed, reroll & keep better, can always take 10"
SGD,55,Collapsible Construction,"A droid sometimes needs to be stowed in places where it usually would not fit. For example, a droid stowed in a smaller cargo space might surprise an enemy. The collapsible construction modification allows a droid to lower its Size category by one when it shuts down. The droid brain enters stand-by mode while it compacts itself into a smaller size. The droid can reactivate at any time as a standard action.

SGD,63,Command station,"On starships and at other installations requiring a large droid population, centralized droid command stations direct and control droids as they carry out their daily operations. A droid or an organic overseer can operate the droid command station. On large starships or major facilities, the station is manned at all hours. Smaller operations might use the station to issue commands and to provide automated oversight. Droids in the command station's pool must have a com link, an integrated comlink, or a remote processor in order to maintain contact with the station. Accessing the station requires the appropriate password or code cylinder. The station typically has Intelligence 14 (or the ship's Intelligence, whichever is higher) and a Will Defense of 15. 

Standard droid command stations provide the following functions with the indicated Use Computer or Mechanics check: 

â¢ Issue a routine command to order a droid in the droid pool to carry out a specific task. If the droid is familiar with the task, or if the droid is trained in the associated skill, no skill check is required. If the command is unusual or highly specific, a Use Computer check might be required at the Gamemaster's discretion. The user gains a +10 equipment bonus to Use Computer, Persuasion, and Perception checks against the droid. Commands can be issued verbally or by keypad.
â¢ Coordinate multiple droids in the pool, enabling them to complete tasks more efficiently. With a DC 15 Use Computer check by the station operator, each droid aiding in a given task provides a +3 bonus instead of a +2 bonus and automatically succeeds on checks to aid another.
â¢ Locate any droid in the droid pool anywhere within the station's operational range-typically the vessel or facility where the station is installed. The target droid must be fitted with a tracking device or a restraining bolt that can be tracked by station's sensors or the facility's security network. A Use Computer check of DC 5 is sufficient to locate any such droid.
â¢ Receive detailed information about a droid's status, including current hit points, position on the condition track, and the operational condition of its systems and accessories. No check is required.
â¢ Reprogram a droid in the pool by remote or direct connection to the station (see page 192 of the Saga Edition core rulebook). 
â¢ Translate between Binary and common languages. No check is required.

SGD,56,Communications Countermeasure System,"One of the first things enemy forces do after discovering a droid is prevent the droid from establishing communications to request rescue or call for help from its allies. A communications countermeasure system prevents jamming of a droid's communications. The system broadcasts signals on multiple frequencies to counteract interference. A droid with a communications countermeasure system gains a +5 equipment bonus to all Use Computer checks made to overcome communications jamming.

",Communications,1000,3,Restricted,+5 Use Computer to overcome jamming
SGD,56,Communications jammer,"When behind enemy lines, a droid takes every possible precaution to ensure that anyone who finds it is unable to call for help or alert others about the droid's presence. The communications jammer allows a droid to jam any comlink signal by interfering with a facility's communications systems or by directly jamming signals in the droid's general vicinity.

A communications jammer grants a droid a +5 equipment bonus when making a Use Computer check to slice into a computer system and shut it down. The droid also gets the +5 equipment bonus to maintain that status if any slicers attempt to stop the jamming. Once the droid has successfully connected with the communications system and begun jamming, it can continue jamming the system until it disconnects or it is forced out.

The signal jammer emits signals at multiple frequencies to interfere with any comlink signals within a 1- kilometer radius of the droid. The droid must make a DC 25 Use Computer check to successfully jam any incoming or outgoing com link signals.

",Communications,5000,5,Military,"+5 Use Computer to slice & shut down computer, +5 to stop slicer's jamming, DC 25 Use Computer to jam incoming or outgoing comlinks w/in 1 km"
SGD,56,Concealed Item,"This system enables the droid to have a weapon or a tool built into a hidden compartment in its body, an appendage, or its head. With this system, a weapon can also be camouflaged to look like a standard tool or appendage. For example, an arm can hide a blaster rifle, or a beam cutter might actually be a blaster pistol. Typically, the size of the appendage must be similar to the size of the concealed weapon or tool. If the item is fully concealed by the droid's armor or outer covering, it cannot be detected by visual observation alone. If a weapon is not fully concealed and portions are visible, such as a muzzle or blade, then when being searched for weapons the droid gains a +5 bonus to Stealth checks to conceal the weapon, plus any weapon size modifier that applies (see page 72 of the Saga Edition core rulebook). The droid also gains a + 10 bonus to Deception checks to create Deceptive Appearances with regards to the concealed item.

The cost of concealing a weapon or a tool equals the base cost of the item plus the cost of the appendage and/or internal storage compartment x 2. The Gamemaster can increase the cost multiplier to account for complex or unusual installations. Deploying a fully concealed weapon is a swift action, and it is subject to the same bonuses and penalties as drawing a weapon.

",Accessory,see text,App+weapon,Restricted,"+5 Stealth to conceal plus size modifiers, +10 Deception to create Deceptive Appearances"
SGD,56,Courier compartments,"Droids are sometimes used as messengers to deliver important messages and items across the galaxy. To protect items entrusted into their care, these droids can have hidden courier compartments installed in their chassis. Such compartments are also favorites of smugglers who own droids. A droid with a courier compartment might walk right past a starport inspection team that is on the way to tear its master's ship apart.

Courier compartments can be installed in four locations within a droid. A courier compartment in the torso can hold an item that is 3 sizes smaller than the droid's size. A compartment in the arm or leg can hold an item that is 4 sizes smaller than the droid's size. A head compartment can hold an item that is 5 sizes smaller. Detecting a courier compartment requires a successful Perception check with a DC equal to the droid's Will Defense +5.

A common accessory in a courier compartment is a toaster, which destroys the contents of the compartment with a brief blast of plasma energy triggered by the droid. Installing a toaster into a courier compartment doubles the cost of the compartment.

Example: S-3PO, a protocol droid in service to Count Czasiz, has a courier compartment hidden in its left arm. As a Medium droid, the compartment can an hold item of up to Fine size, so it can hold the skifter sabacc card the Count needs to guarantee his next win.

SGD,56,Credit reader,"Interplanetary banks and crime lords have one common interest: They need to know how much money a client has before they do business. Whether a line of credit or hard currency, a credit reader determines whether a target's credits are real or if a line of credit exists for that being. The credit reader gives the droid a +5 bonus to any Perception check against any Deception check made to forge credit accounts or financial documents. The droid can also instantly count any sum of hard credits presented to it as a free action.

",Accessory,250,4,-,+2 on Mechanics checks to diagnose problems
CR,192,Downloading and Restoring Memory,"Unlike organic beings, droids have a form of mechanical immortality: If a droid's programming is saved to a computer system, and a new chassis and droid brain can be bought or found, others can attempt to load its memory into the new droid and reactivate the droid.

A successful Use Computer check is required to transfer a droid's programming into a new chassis. The DC for the Use Computer check depends on the type of new chassis being used: 

Same model  DC 20
Different model, same degree DC 25
Different model, different degree DC 35

Each time the transfer is attempted, the droid must make a DC 15 Intelligence check. A failed check indicates that the droid's memory suffers corruption: a permanent reduction of 1d6 Intelligence points. The corrupted programming can't be repaired; if the droid's Intelligence modifier decreases because of corruption, the droid's trained skills must be reduced accordingly.

The droid also loses access to feats that have an Intelligence prerequisite higher than the droid's new Intelligence score. A droid successfully transferred into another droid of the same model resumes functioning as it was before the transfer, retaining all ability scores, class levels, skills, feats, and talents.

A droid successfully transferred into a different model adopts the Strength and Dexterity of the new model but keeps its previous Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The droid retains its trained skills, although skill modifiers based on Strength and Dexterity might need adjusting. Finally, the droid loses one class level (including all associated talents and feats) as it has to reprogram and adapt its memory and sensory inputs for the new chassis.

",Reprogramming,,,,See page 192
CR,192,Droid caller,"Droid Caller: The droid caller is a handheld transmitter weighing 0.2 kg. It transmits a signal to any droid equipped with a restraining bolt. The droid caller overrides a droid's motor function and impels it toward the caller for as long as the device is activated.

A droid with a heuristic processor fitted with a restraining bolt can resist the droid caller with a successful DC 20 Charisma check. If successful, that droid can't be affected by that specific droid caller for 24 hours.

SGD,56,Droid oil bath,"Droids look forward to an oil bath after a long period of work. This standard maintenance procedure lubricates the droid's servos and joints, allowing the droid to move as if it has just come off the assembly line. An oil bath is recommended at least once a week for a droid working in a harsh environment, and once a month for a droid working in a temperate climate or on board a ship. A droid immersed in an oil bath for at least 30 minutes can activate a second wind, even if it has already done so that day. The price of an oil bath depends on the size of the droid: small droids and smaller-100 credits; medium droids-1,000 credits; large droids-5,000 credits; huge droids and larger-10,000 credits.

SGD,64,Droid Socket,"Designed exclusively for astromech droids, the droid socket serves as a station combining copilot, systems monitoring, astrogation, and damage-control operations for minimally crewed craft.

Droid sockets are featured on many snub fighters, the occasional shuttle, and a few airspeeders. They generally must be designed and installed as original equipment, although savvy techs can build their own or transplant one onto a ship that does not normally carry a socket.

Standard droid sockets allow an astromech droid to perform the following tasks:
â¢ Pilot or copilot the ship or vehicle with the pilot's permission; if the pilot is unconscious, permission is not required.
â¢ Act as a system operator to raise, lower, or recharge shields (see page 172 of the Saga Edition core rulebook).
â¢ Act as an engineer to reroute power (see page 172 of the Saga Edition core rulebook).
â¢ Make limited Mechanics checks to jury-rig or otherwise repair a ship's systems as determined by the Gamemaster.
â¢ Make Use Computer checks through the ship's system and built-in scomp link.
â¢ Operate the communications system and sensors.
â¢ Input hyperspace jump coordinates from an astrogation buffer and control the hyperdrive with the Use Computer skill, if the ship has a hyperdrive.
â¢ Operate pilot and droid ejection system-with the pilot's express permission. The droid ejection system fires the droid out of the socket and away from the ship at speed 12.

Standard prohibited actions and systems (can be overridden by the pilot):
â¢ Weapons activation and firing.
â¢ Jumping to hyperspace without approval.

Optional systems that might not be found on every ship include:
â¢ Astromech self-loading system, such as on the Naboo N-1 starfighter.

SGD,57,Earphone binary-to-basic translator,"Binary is the primary language of droids. This translator unit is installed on a droid's Basic-output jack, a standard jack found on most droids that enables them to connect to a terminal or a data pad and to express themselves in written Basic. The translator converts audible Binary into audible Basic, transmitting the spoken words to an earphone receiver. The less expensive version requires a large headphone set, while the more expensive version transmits to an earbud receiver. Detecting the earbud requires a Perception check of DC 20.

SGD,57,Electric defense grid,"Most combat droids are effective at using blasters and other ranged weapons. Some models, however, fail miserably at melee combat and are quickly dispatched by enemies that gain the upper hand in close quarters. To improve a droid's melee defenses, an electric defense grid can be installed either on top of or as part of the droid's armor or outer shell. Whenever a droid with an electric defense grid is damaged by a melee attack, the attacker automatically takes 5 points of energy damage. Melee weapons that rely on energy to cause damage, such as lightsabers, are immune to the effect of the electric defense grid.

CR,190,Heuristic Processor,"Heuristic Processor: This type of processor allows a droid to learn by doing, usually without instruction. The droid is able to reason through several potential solutions to tasks and formulate the best approach. Because of this, a droid with a heuristic processor may use skills untrained, just like any other character. Similarly, the droid can wield a weapon even if it is not proficient in its use (but still takes the normal -5 penalty on attack rolls).

In addition, a droid with a heuristic processor can creatively interpret its instructions, allowing it to complete tasks in a manner that it deems appropriate. A heuristic processor allows a droid to work around its behavioral inhibitors as long as it can justify a given action. For example, a noncombat droid with a heuristic processor can attack and even harm sentient living being as long as it believes that doing so will ultimately save more sentient living beings from harm.

Over time, a droid equipped with a heuristic processor develops a unique personality based on experience. Because of this, memory wipes and restraining bolts are commonly used to ensure that a heuristic processor doesn't allow a droid to stray too far from its intended purpose. Still, some progressive masters actually encourage their droids to break their programming, trusting the droid's judgment to make independent decisions without taking advantage of the situation.

The copy can be concealed within the droid's main processor or be installed as a hidden secondary data store elsewhere within the droid. The backup restores itself 1d6 days after a memory wipe with a successful DC 20 Use Computer check (roll 1d20+ 10, or 1d20+ the droid's current Use Computer skill modifier, whichever is greater). If unsuccessful, the core tries to restore itself again every 1d6 days. Discovering a hidden core requires a Use Computer check against the droid's Will Defense. The character making the Use Computer check must state that he or she is looking for a hidden core or for anything suspicious. For double the standard cost of a hidden core, the core's installer can automatically provide a Will Defense of 30 for this check.

As a free action, the droid can activate the holster, which opens up, providing access to the weapon. The hidden holster provides the benefit of the Quick Draw feat with whatever weapon the droid is keeping in the holster-the droid can draw or holster the weapon as a swift action. To gain this benefit, the droid must have the feat's + 1 base attack bonus prerequisite.

SGD,57,High-Speed Cutting Torch and Welding System,"A droid can be equipped with a powerful cutting torch and a welding system for use in repair operations and for cutting materials, doors, or other items. This bulky and heavy device can be installed only on droids of Medium size or larger. The precision welder can be used for small repairs and for large construction welds, typically in half the time required by a normal welding unit.

SGD,57,Holographic game system,"In spite of all the utilitarian functions that a droid can perform, owners might want to use their droids for entertainment. A holographic game system provides fifteen of the galaxy's more popular games, including dejarik and sabacc. The droid can serve as its master's opponent, or it can run the game so its master can play with another being. The game is projected through the droid's holoprojector (sold separately) and does not require a solid surface for game play. The game-system processor is sufficiently advanced to allow a player to interact with the board as if he or she is actually picking up the holographic playing pieces. The game system is adaptable, allowing ten additional games to be added to its database with a successful DC 15 Use Computer check.

SGD,60,Holographic image disguiser,"The holographic image disguiser hides a droid's true appearance. A central processor installed in the droid's chassis coordinates several small, full-color, high-resolution holoprojectors installed at various points on the droid's body. The disguise r's processor synchronizes the holographic image with the droid's movements and its vocabulator, making the disguise particularly lifelike. The basic model is essentially a standard holoshroud, granting the droid a + 10 equipment bonus to Deception checks using Deceptive Appearance (see page 64 of the Saga Edition core rulebook). An advanced model, for double the price, includes sensor nodes that track a number of other factors, such as ambient temperature and weather conditions, making the image react to those variables. The advanced model allows the droid to disguise its appearance as a full-round action at no penalty.

For example, a droid with a hypodermic syringe as its sole appendage can use the syringe for its intended purpose, but otherwise can only push objects with it. A few instruments are actually designed to clamp, and can thus hold objects, but they are generally delicate. A droid using an instrument of this nature has a carrying capacity (see Encumbrance, page 140) as if its Strength score were one-quarter of its actual value.

CR,192,Memory Wipes,"Although intelligent droids consider it frightful and ghoulish and heroic droids regard it as a fate worse than death, the memory wipe is a fact of existence for most droids. Its primary purpose is to eradicate personality quirks that distinguish an independent droid.

Wiping a droid's memory requires a successful Use Computer check against the droid's Will Defense. The droid must be shut down to perform the memory wipe.

A memory wipe erases one class level per minute. A complete memory wipe reduces a droid to a basic model with no personality quirks and no class abilities. For example, a 3PO Series protocol droid that had been a 1st-level non heroic/4th-level scoundrel becomes a 1st-level non heroic basic model after a 4-minute memory wipe, losing its scoundrel levels and all the corresponding benefits.

SGD,60,Mesh tape dispenser,"Mounted on an appendage, a mesh tape dispenser enables a droid to quickly apply mesh tape to anything within reach of its manipulator (usually an adjacent square). In addition to its more conventional uses, an installed mesh tape dispenser can be used by a droid to entangle an adjacent enemy. With a successful melee attack, the droid can hinder either the target's arms or its leg s. If the target's arms are hindered, it incurs a -2 penalty to all attacks and Dexterity-based skill checks. If the target's legs are hindered, its speed is reduced by 2 squares, and it cannot run. If the droid has the Pin feat and succeeds at an opposed grapple check, the enemy is considered pinned until the tape is removed (instead of until the start of the droid's next turn).

SGD,60,Micro shield,"The force shield is a tool that prevents incoming attacks from hitting and damaging the wielder. Attached to one of the droid's appendages, the shield is composed of a central hub with two wide arcs mounted on struts above and below the hub. When inactive, the arcs rest against the hub in the shape of a large humanoid eye. When the droid activates the unit as a swift action, the arcs slide away from the hub, activating a translucent energy shield that provides a + 1 equipment bonus to the user's Reflex Defense. The force shield is originally designed to be installed on a droid's arm, but a handheld version that runs on a single energy cell is available for 400 credits. The energy cell provides enough power to run the shield continuously for 1 hour.

SGD,60,Multispectrum searchlight,"This handheld or installed accessory is a powerful spotlight that shines visible, infrared, or ultraviolet light. It has a 6-km range and is powered by the droid's own internal power supply. Droids able to see the projected light gain a +2 equipment bonus to Perception checks to Search and Notice Targets (see page 70 of the Saga Edition core rulebook) and to other situations in which the Gamemaster judges that the light provides an advantage. This bonus stacks with bonuses granted by helmet packages and improved sensor packages. 

The light can also be used to blind targets in a 6-square cone. All targets within the cone receive a -10 penalty to Stealth checks. As a standard action, the droid makes a ranged attack against each target's Fortitude Defense. If the attack is successful, the target receives a -5 penalty to attack rolls, Perception checks, Pilot checks, and other skill checks until the end of the droid's next turn. If the attack does not exceed a target's Fortitude Defense, the target receives a -2 penalty instead. This accessory can be used only by droids of Tiny size or larger.

SGD,53,Personality downloader,"Personality Downloader (SGtD): Highly illegal, a personality down loader is a custom-built electronic unit designed to quickly suppress an existing droid's personality with a new one. Thieves, pirates, smugglers, infiltrators, and other scoundrels occasionally use a personality down loader to take control of an enemy's droid for their own use. Using the device requires the attacker to plug the personality downloader into one of the droid's data ports. Droids with locked access or without accessible data ports must be coaxed into complying. Once the personality down loader is attached, the user makes a Use Computer check opposed by the droid's Will Defense. If the check is successful, the personality copies itself to the droid's processor and suppresses the existing personality in 5 minutes. The process is imperfect, however. To maintain control, every 10 minutes the new personality must make another Use Computer check opposed by the original personality. The invading personality continues to use the attacking character's Use Computer skill, even though the actual character is not actively involved after the initial download is successful.

A popular modification is a projectile appendage, usually a hand on humanoid droids. When the projectile is activated, the hand flies toward the target. It is considered a nonlethal weapon. A droid might use a projectile hand in order to stun an aggressor or knock a blaster away rather than risking destruction in a blaster fight. 

The basic package is a tension-spring device that costs 250 cred its to install. A projectile hand is considered to be a ranged simple weapon that deals 2d8 damage. Additionally, the projectile hand can be used to make a ranged disarm attempt against a target within 6 squares.

CR,192,"Reprogramming, skill package","A basic model droid comes with factory-preset skills and a certain set of trained skills, feats, and sometimes talents. These factory-presets are embedded in the droid's core programming and cannot be altered, but many droids have one or more trained skills left unassigned so that they can easily be programmed for their specific duties. Unassigned skills as well as feats and talents gained through level advancement can be altered through reprogramming.

Reprogramming a droid requires a Use Computer check (DC = droid's Will Defense) and 30 minutes of uninterrupted work. Reprogramming feats and talents is more difficult, so you take a -5 penalty on your Use Computer check. Furthermore, feats and talents can only be reprogrammed if they are neither a requirement for any of the droid's prestige classes nor a prerequisite for any feat or talent the droid retains. As always, a droid must meet all prerequisites for any replacement feats or talents. A droid can only have talents he is eligible for based on his classes; thus, a droid with 5 levels in the soldier class could only be reprogrammed with 3 talents that can be taken by soldiers (soldier levels 1, 3, and 5). A droid with 5 levels of soldier and 3 levels of scoundrel could be reprogrammed with 3 soldier talents and 2 scoundrel talents. Reprogramming requires that the droid be shut down for the duration of the procedure (but see ""Droid Self-Reprogramming,"" below).

To reprogram a skill, the programmer must be trained in that skill or purchase a skill package (100 credits). To reprogram a feat or talent, the programmer must either have that feat or talent or purchase a feat or talent package (1,000 credits).

If the droid's owner is unable to do the reprogramming himself, he can hire a professional programmer to do the task for him. The standard cost of hiring a programmer is (droid's Will Defense squared) x 10 credits for a skill, or 10 times this amount for a feat or talent. This cost includes any necessary skill, feat, or talent packages.

The restraining bolt is activated with a handheld device called a droid caller (see below). Restraining bolts must be secured to specific locations on droids. Attaching or removing a restraining bolt is a full - round action and requires a DC 10 Mechanics check.

A droid fitted with a restraining bolt can't upgrade or improve its skills (see Reprogramming, below). A droid with a heuristic processor can attempt to remove its own restraining bolt as a standard action with a successful DC 20 Charisma check followed by a successful DC 15 Mechanics check. A droid that fails the Charisma check can't attempt to remove the restraining bolt again until 24 hours pass.

Exclusive Locomotion System: The droid must spend a move action to engage or disengage this locomotion system. While the system is engaged, the droid can only use the move and run actions.

Limited Locomotion System: The droid can only use this locomotion system for a limited time. After using this locomotion system for 1 round, the droid must make an Endurance check (DC 10, + 1 per check after the first) or it cannot use that locomotion system again for 1 minute (10 rounds).

SGD,53,Rocket arm,"This illegal modification is derived from the nonlethal projectile appendage security systems available for noncombat droids. A rocket arm is essentially a hollowed-out droid arm in which the servo control has been replaced by a short-range rocket engine and fuel. The arm's fine control is eliminated, but the droid can point its arm at a target and fire. The arm detaches and flies at the target, detonating the remaining fuel on impact. Rocket arms are unguided projectiles without targeting computers.

This illegal modification costs 2,000 cred its and installation requires a DC 20 Mechanics check. Failure on the Mechanics check means the rocket might not detach properly when fired, exploding and dealing its damage to the droid and all targets in a 1-square splash radius. The rocket arm is considered to be a ranged heavy weapon that deals 3d8 points of damage upon detonation, with a 1-square splash.

CR,196,Self-destruct system,"To prevent capture and analysis, the droid comes equipped with a powerful explosive. The charge destroys the droid from within (no attack required), and a droid destroyed in this fashion cannot be repaired or salvaged. The explosion is treated as an area attack (+5 attack bonus). The damage to all targets with the area is determined by the droid's size (see below), and the burst radius of the explosion is 2 squares per 4d6 of damage (minimum 2 squares). Droids of Tiny size and smaller do not deal collateral damage when they self-destruct.
