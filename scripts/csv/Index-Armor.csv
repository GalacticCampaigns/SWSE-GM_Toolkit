The beskar'gam is the traditional suit of Mandalorian Armor. Unlike the armor of the Neo-Crusaders (see page 201 of the Knights of the Old Republic Cam­paign Guide), most suits of beskar'gam are individually tailored to the wearer. They usually have various customizations, ranging from simple coloration changes to significant structural alterations. The beskar'gam is extremely rare outside of Mandalorian culture and costs 30,000 more than a traditional suit of Mandalorian armor. True beskar'gam is made of Mandalorian iron (beskar), which is strong enough to deflect blaster fire and even lightsabers, and when worn by a true Mandalorian warrior it can greatly reduce the amount of damage taken even from direct hits. Not all suits of Mandalorian armor are beskar'gam (for example, the armor worn by Neo-Crusaders during the Mandalorian Wars was not made of beskar), but a wearer of the beskar'gam is a fearsome sight indeed. A suit of beskar'gam grants favorable circum­stances on Persuasion checks to intimidate, and if the wearer has DR then the wearer can apply its benefit against attacks made by lightsabers. Though not powered armor, the armor has two free upgrade slots.

Gamemasters can reduce the cost of beskar'gam by 30,000 credits for Mandalorian heroes.

Originally discarded as worthless impurities, the crystals attract the attention of representatives of the Techno Union because of their ability to survive the extreme heat. The research and development team discovers that the crystals, dubbed crystadurium, not only withstand heat and high pressure, but they also resist blaster fire. Working with a design team from Baktoid Combat Automata, they create blaster-resistant armor plating by mixing crystal shards into the durasteel alloy used for the battle droids' armor. The war ends before the armor plating is implemented, and the plans are lost when the Techno Union is absorbed by the Empire. Years later the plans are rediscovered by an Imperial librarian, who sells the plans to several arms manufacturers. Although the armor created from these plans is inferior to the original prototypes, it is remarkably effective at stopping blaster fire. Crystadurium armor is heavier and more expensive than standard heavy armor, but it is sought by military organizations throughout the galaxy because of its ability to reduce damage from blaster attacks by 1 point per die of damage.

K,71,w,"Energy shields, heavy SR 25","Energy Shields (KotORCG)
Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor

Rising to prominence in the days after the Great Sith War, personal energy shields project a thin layer of shielding over an individual character or creature. The popularity of energy shields sparks a revolution in combat tactics, including a surge in the popularity of melee weapons and non-energy projectile weapons. Just as the spread of energy shields is a response to the prominence of energy weapons, they in turn cause warriors to adjust their tactics to deal with personal energy shields.

Energy shields give a character a Shield Rating, which functions exactly as vehicle and starship shields. An energy-shield generator is typically worn on the forearm or upper arm and must be activated as a swift action. Energy shields typically have 5 charges, and energy shields can only be activated once per encounter (the stress on the shield generator causes the device to overload otherwise, so the manufacturers build in fail-safes to prevent such an occurrence). Each activation consumes one charge and lasts through the end of the encounter. An energy shield only protects against weapons that deal energy damage; a weapon that deals any other type of damage bypasses the shield's SR entirely.

Energy shields come in three varieties: light, medium, and heavy. Each energy shield type corresponds to an armor type. A character with an active personal shield without the relevant Armor Proficiency feat takes a -5 penalty to Reflex Defense, and the wearer is denied its Dexterity bonus to Reflex Defense, though he or she still gains the benefit of the shield. Regardless of whether or not the character is proficient in the personal shield, the character always takes the armor check penalty associated with the shield while it is activated. Additionally, each type of energy shield imposes its Maximum Dexterity Bonus restriction only when activated, not when worn and inert. An energy shield can be added to a suit of armor as an accessory. An energy shield can be modified by armor templates (see below) only if the template specifically states that it can be used on energy shields, and the shield confers that benefit only when it is activated.

The SR provided by the energy shield determines the shield's price, as well as the type of Armor Proficiency feat required to operate the shields without penalty. SR 5 and SR 10 energy shields require Armor Proficiency (light); SR 15 and SR 20 energy shields require Armor Proficiency (medium); SR 25 and greater energy shields require Armor Proficiency (heavy). See Table 5-4 for prices of energy shields.

Rising to prominence in the days after the Great Sith War, personal energy shields project a thin layer of shielding over an individual character or creature. The popularity of energy shields sparks a revolution in combat tactics, including a surge in the popularity of melee weapons and non-energy projectile weapons. Just as the spread of energy shields is a response to the prominence of energy weapons, they in turn cause warriors to adjust their tactics to deal with personal energy shields.

Energy shields give a character a Shield Rating, which functions exactly as vehicle and starship shields. An energy-shield generator is typically worn on the forearm or upper arm and must be activated as a swift action. Energy shields typically have 5 charges, and energy shields can only be activated once per encounter (the stress on the shield generator causes the device to overload otherwise, so the manufacturers build in fail-safes to prevent such an occurrence). Each activation consumes one charge and lasts through the end of the encounter. An energy shield only protects against weapons that deal energy damage; a weapon that deals any other type of damage bypasses the shield's SR entirely.

Energy shields come in three varieties: light, medium, and heavy. Each energy shield type corresponds to an armor type. A character with an active personal shield without the relevant Armor Proficiency feat takes a -5 penalty to Reflex Defense, and the wearer is denied its Dexterity bonus to Reflex Defense, though he or she still gains the benefit of the shield. Regardless of whether or not the character is proficient in the personal shield, the character always takes the armor check penalty associated with the shield while it is activated.

Initially used on worlds where traditional armor plating was in short supply, fiber armor is specially designed to channel energy-weapon attacks away from the body. The various metal fibers woven into the exterior of this armor cause it to absorb and harmlessly disperse energy damage. However, fiber armor is far from perfect, and lucky shots manage to hit. Once per encounter, a character fighting defensively while wearing fiber armor can gain DR 10 against a single ranged energy attack as a reaction.

For over 100 years, the Galactic Alliance has used variations of its own light armor design, usually in dark blue hues with black accents. In its most recent form, the armor combines a padded armor base with a reinforced breastplate and fully armored gauntlets. Some front-line troopers also use a fully enclosed helmet with helmet package, but this varies by unit. It is not uncommon to see officers and others opt to use Galactic Alliance uniform hats and caps instead.

Some variations of the standard Galactic Alliance uniform incorporate a flexible blast vest and a tight-fitting, open -faced helmet into their designs. This type is especially prevalent among the fleet crews at battle stations. It provides the same bonuses as a regular blast helmet and vest (see page 132 of the Saga Edition core rulebook).

Issued several months after the Battle of Geonosis, Katarn-class commando armor is a superior, specialized armor, designed with input from clone commandos in the field. The armor is unusually thick, with a sealed system allowing the wearer to survive underwater or in vacuum for up to 24 hours. It also features a built-in, retractable, wrist-mounted vibroblade. This highly sought after armor is rarely found in the possession of civilians. Its black- market price can exceed a quarter-million credits. Clone commandos swear by the armor's effectiveness, even though they also grumble beneath their breath about its lack of comfort during long missions.

Katarn-class commando armor grants a wearer with the Armor Proficiency (heavy) feat a +2 bonus on Perception checks, as well as low-light vision. The armor includes an integrated comlink in the helmet, allowing hands-free communication.

As a full-round action, the wearer can use the bacta tanks built into the armor. The bacta and the suit's built-in diagnostic gear grant the wearer an effective Treat Injury +10 skill for self-treatment. The wearer ignores the —5 penalty for self-administration of this skill.

Katarn-class commando armor is highly customizable. If you are using the Armor Upgrades option from Scum and Villainy, the Katarn-class com­mando armor has the Vacuum Seal upgrade and room for three additional upgrades.

J,62,w,Orbalisk armor,"Orbalisk Armor (JATM)
Heavy Armor

Orbalisk armor is unique in that it can only be obtained by subjecting oneself to parasites known as orbalisks, native to Dxun. The orbalisks bond with the host and usually drain the host of energy; however, someone with sufficient strength in the dark side of the Force (that is, possessing a Dark Side Score equal to his or her Wisdom score) can prevent the orbalisks from killing him, instead forming a symbiotic relationship with the parasites.

A character with orbalisk armor gains DR 10; unlike normal DR, a lightsaber does not ignore the DR of the orbalisk armor. Since orbalisk armor is bonded directly to the skin of the wearer, it cannot be removed except through complex medical proce­dures (requiring surgery, as per the Treat Injury skill). However, since orbalisk armor is not worn in the traditional sense, the wearer takes no armor check penalty on skill checks for not being proficient in heavy armor.

Inferior in all respects but weight to Mandalorian Neo-Crusader armor, Republic combat armor nonetheless provides valuable protection to soldiers on the ground. It includes a helmet, boots and gauntlets. The helmet provides any wearer who has the Armor Proficiency (medium) feat with an internal comlink and low-light-vision capabilities.

Riot shields are common gear for law enforcement and planetary defense forces. Measuring about 1 meter long and half as wide, a riot shield is made of a metal frame that generates an energy shield that bends light so that its outer surface is opaque while its inner side is transparent, allowing you unobstructed vision but not extending the same benefit to your opponents. A riot shield has DR 5, 20 hit points, and a break DC of 25.

When held, a riot shield grants you cover (+5 cover bonus to your Reflex Defense) against all ranged attacks on any turn during which you fight defensively. You can also wield a riot shield as a melee weapon. When used in this way, it has the same statistics as a stun baton (SE 123).

While personal shield devices have fallen out of use in much of the galaxy, they can still be found among the nobility of Kilia IV. Kilian Rangers use a shield gauntlet to both provide defense and remind themselves and others of the other half of their oaths: to defend themselves and their families. A shield gauntlet can be worn even if you are wearing other armor, although you cannot wear any items that cover your hands (such as combat gloves, stun gauntlets, a cortosis gauntlet, or shockboxing gloves) with a shield gauntlet. A shield gauntlet provides no benefit to the untrained, but those with certain talents (see the Kilian Ranger talent tree on page XX) can use it to deflect ranged attacks.

A character without the Armor Proficiency (light) feat suffers armor check penalties as usual when wearing a shield gauntlet. A shield gauntlet requires an energy cell to operate.

Worn by the elite soldiers of the Galactic Empire, stormtrooper armor comes in a variety of models based around a standard white- and-black shell. Filled with electronics that assist and augment the stormtrooper in his duties, it includes rudimentary environmental protection, three - phase sonic filtering, and visual amplification.

Variants of this armor also exist, including snowtrooper armor, sandtrooper armor, and clone trooper armor. Each has slightly different details, but all include the basic characteristics common to all stormtrooper armor. Though unavailable on the open market, these suits can occasionally be found on the black market (or sometimes much higher).

Stormtrooper armor (including all variants) grants a wearer who has the Armor Proficiency (light) feat a +2 equipment bonus on Perception checks as well as low-light vision. Stormtrooper armor also includes an integrated comlink in the helmet, allowing hands-free communication.

Wearing snowtrooper armor (18,000 credits) makes you immune to the effects of extreme cold (see Extreme Temperatures, page 254). Wearing sandtrooper armor (18,000 credits) makes you immune to the effects of extreme heat (see Extreme Temperatures, page 254).

Lined with micro­filaments attached to a power cell, the stun cloak can emit a powerful electric shock to any character who grapples or is grappled by the wearer. Officers and nobles wear stun cloaks to thwart kidnapping attempts, and commandos who expect to engage in close combat also wear them. The interior of the cloak is insulated to prevent accidental shocks to the wearer.

If the wearer successfully makes a grapple attack or is successfully grappled by an enemy, the stun cloak deals 3d8 points of stun damage.

By doubling the price, the stun cloak can be upgraded to include the same capabilities as an all-temperature cloak (see page 138 of the Saga Edition core rulebook) or the camouflage poncho (see page 46). Otherwise, the stun cloak cannot be upgraded with the Armor Upgrades option from Scum and Villainy.

It provides the wearer with a +5 bonus to Fortitude Defense when resisting extreme temperatures. In addition, the suit further reduces damage taken in such circumstances.

The vest features pockets, pouches, and straps capable of carrying up to twenty-four small objects weighing no more than 1 kilogram each. Because the items are stored so that their weight is distributed evenly around the wearer's torso, their cumulative weight is halved for purposes of calculating the wearer's total carried weight.

Heavy Armor

The Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) pod, or vacuum pod, is a droid-assisted suit of powered armor specifically designed to allow a person to repair a starship while in space. Its systems are designed in so that a wearer not proficient with heavy armor can use it competently in nonstressful situations. The suit, once donned properly, provides full life support to its wearer and also includes external thrusters to allow movement in a zero-gravity environment (speed fly 6). It also features motorized limbs, a complete set of integrated repair tools, and an external compartment to allow the user to carry any extra materials needed to make repairs. The suit's functions are controlled by a dedicated, low-level droid brain that handles all the complex systems of the suit, such as the life support monitoring system and the regulation of the external thrusters.

Vacuum pod users who have the Armor Proficiency (heavy) feat can use the following features and receive the bonuses listed. A wearer who does not have the feat can still use the suit but does not receive any of the equipment bonuses listed below, unless otherwise noted. Regardless, the wearer has any armor check penalties halved while in noncombat situations. Putting on the suit and bringing all the droid's systems online takes 15 minutes. Removing the suit takes only 3 rounds.

Comlink: The suit's integrated comlink has a range of 100 kilometers and can send and receive encrypted messages.
Life Support: The suit provides up to 2 hours of continuous life support with air supply and protection against extreme environments, including hard vacuum.
Powerlamp: The armor comes with an integrated glowrod, which emits a 70-sguare cone of light.
Repair Kit: The tools integrated in the suit's motorized arms give the user a +2 bonus on all Mechanics checks while the systems function.
Strength Augmentation: The suit's power systems grant the wearer a +4 bonus to Strength while the suit is operational.

Part powered armor, part armored spacesuit, Venom Assault armor provides ample protection from hostile attackers and environments. Additionally, the wearer can activate the armor's limited jump jets as a swift action to move at normal speed in zero-g. The jets are not powerful enough to lift an armored trooper in normal gravity. The suit also adds a +2 equipment bonus to the wearer's Strength. However, the wearer must have the Armor Proficiency (heavy) feat to use either the jets or gain the bonus to Strength.

The wearer may survive up to 24 hours in the vacuum of space or other hostile environmental conditions. Much like other Galactic Alliance uniforms and armor sets, the Venom Assault armor has a dark blue and black color scheme and prominently features the Galactic Alliance logo on the shoulder pauldrons.

Heavy Armor

Designed to enable the Emperor's elite spacetroopers to cut their way through the hull of an enemy vessel during starship combat, zero-gravity stormtrooper armor is essentially a small starfighter. Over two meters tall and twice as wide as a normal Human, zero-gravity armor has earned the spacetroopers the nickname ""walking tanks."" There have been several versions of the zero-gravity armor; the fist two iterations were large, bulky, and really more like small starfighters. The armor presented here is the light spacetrooper armor, which was developed after the Mark II version of the armor came into service.

All zero-gravity stormtrooper armor incorporates shoulder- mounted grenade launchers (loaded with concussion, stun, and gas grenades), a blaster cannon, and a miniature proton - torpedo launcher. The gauntlets are fitted with either rotating blades or laser cutters, enabling spacetroopers to cut through the hulls of enemy craft. The armor is currently manufactured only for Medium characters, and increases the wearer's size to Large. Routine maneuvers in zero-g stormtrooper armor do not require a Pilot check, but the wearer must make a DC 15 Pilot check to perform any maneuver more complicated than simple movement.
