For example, if the heroes need information on a crime lord but have no one trained in Gather Information, the noble uses this talent, and his contacts supply the heroes with the information from the resulting Gather Information check. Likewise, if the heroes need to get past a security checkpoint in a very important mission, the noble calls upon his influential friends to have a Deception check made to provide the heroes with high-quality fake identification and paperwork.
