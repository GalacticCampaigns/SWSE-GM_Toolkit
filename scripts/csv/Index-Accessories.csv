Armor Upgrade

This upgrade seals your armor against the pressure of deep ocean travel, allows you to filter breathable air out of water indefinitely, and uses fins and small jets to allow swift and easy motion through liquids. When wearing this armor, you gain a swim speed equal to one-half your armored walking speed and can breathe in water.

SV,42,X,Bayonet ring,"Bayonet Ring (SaV)
Weapon Upgrade

A bayonet ring is a simple upgrade added to a melee weapon of Small or lesser size. Once upgraded, the weapon can be mounted on a specific type of ranged weapon. The type of ranged weapon must be chosen at the time you install the upgrade; the weapon must be of at least Medium size, and it cannot require a tripod or other mount for any normal operation (such as a heavy repeating blaster). The most common combination is placing a vibrodagger on a blaster rifle, but other combinations are possible as well (such as a stun baton mounted onto a grenade launcher, a combination preferred for riot control).

While the upgraded melee weapon is mounted on its ranged weapon, the combined weapon becomes Large size, and it must be wielded in two hands. In addition, the melee weapon's damage dice increase by one step: d2 to d3, d3 to d4, d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12. However, its damage type and weapon group stay the same despite these changes, and it is otherwise treated as a bayonet in all respects (see ""Gun Club"" and ""Bayonet"" on pages 52 and 121 of the Saga Edition core rulebook). Both the melee weapon with the bayonet ring upgrade and the ranged weapon can be used separately; mounting or removing the upgraded melee weapon requires a move action.

K,75,w,Beam splitter,"Beam Splitter (KotORCG)
Weapon Upgrade

A modification made only to pistols, rifles, heavy weapons, and exotic ranged weapons that deal energy damage, the beam splitter accessory makes it easier to fire a powerful energy bolt by increasing the size of the bolt fired. Once per encounter, the wielder of a weapon with a beam splitter that uses the Power Blast feat to modify an attack roll deals 2 points of damage for every 1 point subtracted from the attack bonus.

A beckon call is a small communications device that links up with the slave circuits on a starship. When activated, the beckon call transmits a signal to the starship it is linked to, activating its autopilot programming and sum足moning the ship to the nearest safe spot close to the wielder. A beckon call functions only when connected to a starship with a slave circuit.

SV,43,X,Bipod,"Bipod (SaV)
Weapon Upgrade

A bipod is an attached two-legged stand that steadies the barrel of a rifle or heavy weapon when aiming or using autofire. Preparing a bipod for use is a move action, and you cannot prepare a bipod unless you are either prone or adjacent to low objects (or other waist- to chest-high cover) that are between you and your target. If you move, you cannot use the bipod until you prepare it again.

A bipod counts as a mount for any weapon that requires it (such as a heavy repeating blaster or E-web repeating blaster). For other weapons, a bipod makes aiming easier. If you have already aimed at or attacked a particular target, each subsequent aim action requires only a single swift action. (Under these circumstances, a character with the Sniping Master talent can aim as a free action once per round; see page 29.) This benefit is lost if you attack or aim at any other target. A bipod adds 20% to the weight of the weapon (minimum 1 kg).

J,60,w,Blade lock,"Blade Lock (JATM)
Lightsaber Upgrade

This simple modification is usually added only to lightsabers whose wielders frequently throw the lightsaber as a ranged weapon. As a swift action, the wielder can lock the blade in place; when doing so, this prevents the lightsa足ber from being accidentally deactivated when the weapon is jarred, such as during the impact of being thrown. A swift action unlocks the blade, meaning that it takes two swift actions to deactivate a locked lightsaber blade.

SV,40,w,Cheater,"Cheater (SaV)
Universal Upgrade

A cheater is a hand-held device designed to allow you to cheat at the popular gambling game of sabacc. Because they are illegal (and likely to get you killed to boot), cheaters are usually disguised and added to another piece of functional equipment.

While you use a cheater, you gain a +2 equipment bonus on the Wisdom check made to determine the outcome of gambling games (see the ""Gam足bling"" sidebar on page 47 of the Saga Edition core rulebook). You have to make a Stealth check opposed by any observers' Perception checks to conceal the use of a cheater, but you gain a bonus on your check determined by the object's size. (Generally, cheaters are placed in Fine-sized devices such as credit chips or comlinks, granting a +10 size bonus on Stealth checks to conceal their use.) However, if anyone ever beats your Wisdom check in a sabacc game by 6 or more, that person realizes you must be cheating some足how (though they won't know exactly how-often leading to a demand for a search of your possessions).

A cheater installed into a rigged sabacc card is called a skifter.

SV,45,X,Climbing claws,"Climbing Claws (SaV)
Armor Upgrade

Climbing claws are retractable spikes worked into the arms and legs of a suit of armor. When wearing this armor, you gain a climb speed equal to one-half your armored walking speed. Additionally, you can reroll a failed Climb check (keeping the better result) and can take 10 on Climb checks even when rushed or threatened.

The wearer can use climbing claws to attack foes in melee. They count as being weapons two sizes smaller than the wearer, and they deal slashing damage equal to the base claw damage for a beast of that size (see page 274 of the Saga Edition core rulebook). For example, a Medium character would have Tiny climbing claws that deal 1d4 slashing damage. If you are proficient with the suit of armor you're wearing, you are proficient with any climbing claws installed on it.

Universal Upgrade

Cloaked equipment has its energy signatures baffled, any noises it makes muffled, and its appearance camouflaged and slenderized, and it comes with a case that allows it to be placed in an inconspicuous location. When not in use, such equipment imposes a -5 penalty on any Perception or Use Computer check made to detect it. When in use, it imposes only a -2 penalty on such checks. Weapons are obvious when in use, even if cloaked. Cloaked armor does not help with Stealth checks made to sneak, but it applies when you make a Deception check to produce a deceptive appearance (such as making the armor appear as ordinary clothing).

GI,68,X,Componentization,"Componentization (GoI)
Universal Upgrade

Componentization is a process where a single piece of equipment or weapon is composed of several different pieces, each of which is disguised to appear as another type of equipment, such as a comlink, a datapad, or even a vibroshaver. Componentization is a common upgrade for assassins, smugglers, and nobles who want to carry weapons or other equipment into a location secretly.

The basic componentization upgrade (one upgrade slot) breaks the item or weapon into two component parts, each one size category smaller than the original item. An item or weapon with the deluxe upgrade (two upgrade slots) breaks down into four items, each two size categories smaller than the original item. For example, a Medium sporting blaster rifle can break down into two Small objects with the basic upgrade or into four Tiny objects with the deluxe upgrade.

A full round is required to assemble a componentized item from two parts. Two full rounds are required to assemble a componentized item from four parts. Identifying a component as part of this upgrade package requires a DC 30 Perception or DC 25 Knowledge (technology) check.

SV,43,X,Double trigger,"Double Trigger (SaV)
Weapon Upgrade

A weapon with a double trigger treats one trigger as a ""safety,"" with the second trigger being a hair-trigger that fires when the slightest pressure is applied to it. Weapons of this type can be extremely accurate, since only a small amount of pressure is needed to fire them (reducing the chance of moving the weapon slightly while pulling the trigger), but this takes time and training. If a character has Careful Shot, he gains a +2 bonus on attacks if he aims with a weapon that has a double trigger (rather than the normal +1 bonus provided by the feat).
",R,0,Common,800,,+2 bonus when aiming using Careful Shot instead of only +1,
SV,40,w,Droidification,"Droidification (SaV)
Universal Upgrade

Droidification is an extensive process that turns a common piece of equipment into a fully functioning droid. The equipment can either act as a droid with access to the equipment it was built from, or conceal itself as a normal piece of equipment. While concealing itself as normal equipment, the droid can't take any actions and a DC 25 Perception check is required to realize the equipment is unusual.

The droidified equipment uses the statistics of an ASP labor droid with the following modifications determined by the equipment's size: -3 Strength, +1 Dexterity, and -2 squares of speed per size smaller than Medium, but no score can be reduced to less than 1. (This is actual size, not weapon size; see ""Equipment Sizes"" on page 38). Apply all modifiers to the statistics for the object's size as normal. The droid is automatically considered to have (and be proficient with) the equipment it is built out of, and although it does not automatically gain any skills needed to use itself as equipment, owners commonly program the droid's unspent feat on an appropriate Skill Training feat. Only devices can receive this upgrade. Weapons, armor, and vehicles cannot be droidified.

Example: Deel Surool owns a datapad he'd like to be able to call (like a pet). Since a datapad has only one upgrade slot, he increases its size to Diminutive (due to its weight, it is a Fine item; see Table 2-1: Equipment Size). He then pays to have it droidified. This makes it the equivalent of an ASP labor droid with Strength 8, Dexterity 15, and speed 1 square. Since it is a walking datapad, Deel programs it to use its unassigned feat for Skill Training in Use Computer (giving it Use Computer +3), enough to download data from an unprotected system.

If any additional droid equipment or systems are added to the droidified equipment, it becomes obvious that the device is a droid rather than the original item.

SV,41,X,Dual gear,"Dual Gear (SaV)
Universal Upgrade

One piece of equipment can be built into another as an upgrade, but it is impossible to place a larger piece of gear into a smaller piece-you can't cram a blaster cannon into a lightsaber. Dual gear can act as either piece of component gear without penalty. For example, a glow rod that has been upgraded to include a hold-out blaster can illuminate or shoot, as the user desires. Normally, such equipment can't act as both pieces of equipment at once. You must pay the full price for the piece of equipment being added to the primary object as dual gear.

If either piece of equipment requires a power pack or other energy source, it must have its own (items combined with this modification cannot share power packs or other energy sources).

The durasteel bonding accessory coats an advanced melee weapon, a melee exotic weapon, or a melee simple weapon with a thin layer of durasteel, making it more resistant to damage and ensuring that it retains its keen edge over time. A weapon with durasteel bonding increases its own DR by 5 and deals an extra die of damage on a critical hit (this die of damage is added after damage is multiplied for the critical hit). This accessory can only be placed on a weapon that deals slashing damage.

SV,41,X,Electrograpple handle,"Electrograpple Handle (SaV)
Universal Upgrade

An electrograpple handle is a magnetized section of equipment designed to fly toward a specially attuned grapple gauntlet (the cost of which is included in the upgrade cost). A piece of equipment with an electrograpple handle can be retrieved by a character wearing the attuned grapple gauntlet as a move action out to a range of 6 squares. If the equipment is held or strapped down, the grapple gauntlet allows a Strength check with a +5 bonus to rip it free. This is used as an opposed Strength check (to remove it from someone holding it) or against the break DC of the straps restraining it.

This is most often used on a weapon. This allows a character to throw down a weapon to ""prove"" he is disarmed, only to retrieve it at range when trouble starts.

A purely cosmetic accessory, electrum detail decorates the lightsaber handle with the rare metal electrum, giving it a distinctive gold color.

One end of this small cord of metal fibers attaches to the hilt of a lightsaber. The other end is attached to a piece of armor or a metal gauntlet, making it more difficult to disarm the wielder. When the wielder of a lightsaber with a fiber cord is disarmed, the disarming character cannot catch the weapon (or call it to their hand, if using Force disarm). The weapon is still considered ""dropped"" and the wielder must spend an action to pick it up, though it hangs by its fiber cord until the wielder does so.

SV,46,w,Holoshroud,"Holoshroud (SaV)
Armor Upgrade

A holoshroud upgrade places small holographic projectors as key points around the armor. These projectors are linked together and designed to place a holographic image over the armor (and its wearer). The image moves as the armor moves, making the illusion of a different appearance difficult to penetrate.

The holoshroud can store only a single image, which must be of the same basic size and shape as the armor (generally humanoid). The image can be changed with an hour of work and a DC 20 Use Computer check.

The holoshroud provides a +10 equipment bonus on Stealth checks to con足ceal items (underneath the image) as well as any Deception checks made to create a deceptive appearance matching the image. However, the holoshroud doesn't withstand scrutiny, so any observer who uses a full-round action to search the wearer gains a +10 circumstance bonus on the opposed Percep足tion check. Furthermore, the holoshroud doesn't have any tactile, auditory, or olfactory component, so observers with the scent species trait or using a sensor pack gain a +10 circumstance bonus on their Perception checks.

The holoshroud draws power from a standard energy cell, which gives enough power for twenty rounds of use (drawn in any increment). Such armors are often upgraded with the Extra Power Source or Internal Generator modification to extend this operating time. You can turn a holoshroud on or off as a swift action.

The generator can be activated or deactivated as a swift action. As long as it's active, an internal generator can simultaneously power up to ten different devices that have negligible power requirements (anything without a listed duration).

For devices with specific power requirements, an internal generator can store four units of energy (each the equivalent of an energy cell, power pack, or 20 rounds of power from a portable fusion generator), and it automatically recharges one such unit every hour. A suit of armor can receive this upgrade multiple times if more energy capacity is needed, but each internal generator adds 10 kg to the weight of the armor.

The biggest drawback to a generator is its energy signature. If the gen足erator powers anything but devices with negligible power requirements, any character attempting to detect the wearer with a sensor pack or vehicle sensors gains a +5 circumstance bonus on the Perception or Use Computer check.

Any device that has an Intelligence score (such as a computer) can have its memory upgraded, improving its performance and storage capacity. The basic memory upgrade increases the device's Intelligence by +2 and doubles the device's storage capacity. Unless otherwise specified, an unmodified computer holds a number of memory units equal to 5 x the square of the computer's Intelligence bonus. (A single memory unit holds the same amount of data as a recording rod, and 10 memory units are enough to hold coordi足nates for a single hyperspace jump.)

An advanced memory upgrade is also available, which increases Intel足ligence by +4 and multiplies the device's storage capacity by 5. (This replaces the benefit of the standard memory upgrade.)

Memory upgrades cannot be installed on droids (including droidified equipment).

Armor Upgrade

Designed with the same principles as mesh armor, the mesh underlay acces足sory helps channel certain types of energy away from the wearer's body, reducing the effectiveness of a potentially devastating blow. A character wearing a suit of armor with the mesh underlay accessory gains a +5 equip足ment bonus to his damage threshold against stun damage.

SV,41,X,Miniaturized,"Miniaturized (SaV)
Universal Upgrade

Equipment with the miniaturized upgrade weighs half as much, and is one size smaller (see ""Equipment Sizes"" on page 38). A melee weapon that is miniaturized has its damage dice reduced by one step (d6s become d4s, d4s become d3s, and so on) because it lacks the mass and striking surface area to deal more damage.

SV,43,X,Missile load,"Missile Load (SaV)
Weapon Upgrade

A grenade's charge can be converted into a missile warhead. Once turned into a missile, the device cannot be thrown as a grenade. The primary advan足tages of missile loads are their greater effect and range when fired from a missile launcher. (The standard missile is essentially a missile load for a frag grenade, so only energy balls, ion grenades, and stun grenades can be fitted as missile loads.) Increase the damage dice of the original grenade by 50% when converted to a missile load. For example, an energy missile deals 3d8 damage, and a stun missile deals 6d6 stun damage.

SV,43,w,Neutronium reinforcement,"Neutronium Reinforcement (SaV)
Weapon Upgrade

Neutronium is a heavy, neutron-rich metallic alloy used to make armor and reinforce starships. It can also be used to harden and sharpen the striking or cutting surface of a melee weapon other than a lightsaber. Any equipment given neutronium reinforcement gains +5 DR (maximum 15), 10 hit points, and +100% weight. A slashing or piercing melee weapon given neutronium reinforcement scores a critical hit on a natural roll of 19 or 20. (Only a natural 20 is an automatic hit, however.)

SV,43,X,Overload switch,"Overload Switch (SaV)
Weapon Upgrade

An overload switch allows any energy weapon to build a feedback loop that causes it to explode. When activated as a swift action, the weapon becomes an improvised thrown weapon (-5 penalty on your ranged attack roll) with a 2-square burst. (See ""Area Attacks,"" page 155 of the Saga Edition core rulebook). A weapon whose size is two or more steps greater than yours (such as a Human using an E-web) cannot be thrown, so it will instead detonate at the end of your turn.

The overloaded weapon deals energy damage equal to double its normal damage dice; for example, an overloaded blaster pistol deals 6d6 damage. Once the override switch is used, the weapon is destroyed. This modifica足tion cannot be added to energy balls, grenades, thermal detonators, or other normally explosive devices.

SV,46,X,Powered exoskeleton,"Powered Exoskeleton (SaV)
Armor Upgrade

Much like the Corellian powersuit, other armor can be upgraded to include a powered exoskeleton that enhances the physical strength of the wearer. Because of the weight and energy required, only medium and heavy armor can have the powered exoskeleton upgrade.

A powered exoskeleton operates for 20 rounds on a standard energy cell. (Suits of armor with a powered exoskeleton commonly have the internal generator upgrade; see above.) Turning an exoskeleton on or off is a swift action. When active, the exoskeleton gives the wearer a +2 equipment bonus to Strength. A powered exoskeleton adds 5 kg to the weight of the armor.

SV,43,X,Pulse charger,"Pulse Charger (SaV)
Weapon Upgrade

Any blaster weapon can be fitted with a pulse charger. A pulse charger forces more power into the blast chamber, producing more powerful shots at the expense of lost accuracy. This upgrade causes a -1 penalty on all attack rolls with the weapon, but the weapon deals +1 point of damage per die. Thus, a sporting blaster pistol with a pulse charger imposes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and deals 3d4+3 damage on a hit. A blaster with a pulse charger has only one-half the normal number of shots from a power pack.

SV,46,X,Radiation shielding,"Radiation Shielding (SaV)
Armor Upgrade

Radiation shielding is necessarily heavy and bulky. Only medium and heavy armor can be modified with radiation shielding, and it increases the armor's weight by 10 kg. The shielding grants a +10 equipment bonus to your Forti足tude Defense against radiation attacks, and it reduces any damage dealt by a successful radiation attack by 5 points. In addition, any time you would move -1 persistent step down the condition track as a result of radiation damage while wearing this armor, you can make a DC 20 Endurance check to negate the persistent condition. You can make this check only the first time you move down the condition track due to a particular radiation hazard; if you fail, you must have the persistent condition cured normally.

SV,43,w,Rangefinder,"Rangefinder (SaV)
Weapon Upgrade

Any ranged weapon can have a rangefinder built into it. Such a weapon takes no penalty when used to attack a target at short range. Thus, a blaster pistol with a rangefinder upgrade takes no range penalty on attacks against targets up to 40 squares away.

This is essentially an improved version of a targeting scope, and thus its benefits do not stack with those of targeting scopes. (However, a weapon can have both a rangefinder and a targeting scope, using the latter only when aiming at targets at medium or long range.)

A range finder built into a suit of armor works like a weapon rangefinder (see above), but it applies only to ranged attacks made by weapons built into the armor on a weapon mount (see below). Its benefits apply to other ranged weapons only if you aim immediately before making the attack.

Any attack using a rangefinder takes no penalty when used against a target at short range. Thus, if your suit of armor had a rangefinder and a blaster pistol built into a weapon mount, you would take no range penalty on attacks against targets up to 40 squares away.

SV,47,X,Ready harness,"Ready Harness (SaV)
Armor Upgrade

A ready harness is a series of hooks, straps, and clips distributed around the armor, designed to make equipment easily accessible and to settle its weight more comfortably on the wearer's frame. A ready harness can hold two Small pieces of equipment (Large weapon size), five Tiny pieces of equip足ment (Medium weapon size), or ten pieces of equipment up to Diminutive size (Small weapon size).

Weight of equipment in the ready harness is halved for purposed of deter足mining your encumbrance (see page 140 of the Saga Edition core rulebook), and such equipment can be retrieved or replaced as a move action.

Equipment with a recognition system can identify its owner and won't function for anyone else. Fooling a recognition system takes 1 minute and a DC 30 Use Computer check. The owner of gear with this upgrade can deac足tivate it as a free action (before passing a weapon to an unarmed ally, for example); optionally, the recognition system can have a code phrase that allows anyone to deactivate it.

SV,41,X,Remote activation,"Remote Activation (SaV)
Universal Upgrade

This upgrade allows a piece of equipment to be activated with a signal from a comlink or similar communications device. Although typically associated with explosives or security systems, remote activation can be used to set a droid to activate, a fusion lantern to flare to life, a computer to start running a program, or a holoprojector to begin a recorded projection. Activating a remote is a swift action, which includes entering the special command code (allowing a single comlink to activate multiple pieces of remote gear, one swift action per item activated).

The range of remote activation is determined by the comlink or other communication device used. Any comlink can be used to activate the gear, sending a signal with a specific code along a specific frequency. A character aware of a piece of remotely activated gear can find the necessary frequency and activation code with a DC 30 Use Computer check.

This upgrade takes the same kind of hover repulsorlifts used by droids and modifies them to allow the armor to float up to 1 meter off the ground. The wearer can activate or deactivate the repulsorlift as a swift action. While the repulsorlift is operating, the wearer ignores the effects of difficult ter足rain and takes half damage from falls. A repulsorlift operates for 10 rounds on a single energy cell.

Any rifle or pistol (as well as rifle- or pistol-like exotic weapons) can have a retractable stock added. This upgrade requires 1 upgrade point for a pistol, but 0 upgrade points for a rifle. (A rifle already has a stock, which can be replaced with the retractable stock.) The rules for using a retractable stock are detailed on page 125 of the Saga Edition core rulebook.

Certain weapons come with a retractable stock as a standard feature, as detailed in their descriptions. No upgrade points are spent in this case.

SV,41,X,Secret compartment,"Secret Compartment (SaV)
Universal Upgrade

Like storage capacity (see below), this upgrade allows gear to carry smaller gear within it. However, the gear carried in a secret compartment is con足cealed. It takes a DC 30 Perception check to notice the compartment when it is used, and a DC 25 Perception check to find it with a close, hands-on examination. Equipment with a secret compartment upgrade can hold a single item one size smaller than the equipment itself. (This is actual size, not weapon size; see ""Equipment Sizes"" on page 38.) Thus, a blaster pistol (Small weapon, Diminutive object) with a secret compartment can hold a Fine-sized object (such as a comlink or frag grenade).

A matte black finish of light- and sensor-absorbing material, a shadowskin turns any armor coated with it into a stealth suit. Normally coupled with a sound dampener (included in this modification cost), it is difficult to see, hear or detect the armor with sensors. Armor with shadowskin grants a +5 equipment bonus on all Stealth checks made by the wearer.

A more advanced version of shadowskin uses the material reflec, which was developed by the Grand Army of the Republic and later used by various Imperial special forces units. Reflec is more effective but also more expensive than normal shadowskin. A suit of armor with reflec shadowskin adds a +10 equipment bonus on its wearer's Stealth checks.

Armor Upgrade

A deflector shield generator can be built into a suit of medium or heavy armor, giving it the same kind of protection starships and some battle droids enjoy. Due to their bulk and power requirements, it is not possible to install anything but the smallest of generators into a suit of armor; in fact, only heavy armor of at least Medium size can carry a shield generator with SR 10.

Shield generators operate for 10 rounds on a standard energy cell. (Suits of armor with shield generators commonly have the Internal Generator upgrade; see above.) Turning a shield generator on or off is a swift action. When active, reduce the damage you take by the armor's shield rating. If the damage is equal to or greater than the armor's shield rating, the shield rating is reduced by 5. By spending three swift actions on the same or consecutive rounds, the wearer can make a DC 20 Mechanics check to restore lost shield power. If the check succeeds, the armor's shield rating increases by 5 points (up to its maximum shield rating).

A shockweb is a powerful electrified stun field that can encase the entire surface of the armor. It runs off an energy cell, which can power it for 20 minutes. Turning the shockweb on or off is a swift action. While the shock足web is active, any time you are the target of a successful melee attack, grab attack, or grapple attack, the attacker takes 1d6 electrical damage and 2d6 electrical stun damage. Each time an attacker is damaged in this way, the shockweb discharges 1 minute of duration off its energy cell.

Universal Upgrade

Silverplate is a special chroming process that adds a layer of tough composite material (often dallorian alloy) across the surface of any piece of gear. In addition to looking stylish, this gives the gear +2 DR (maximum 20). Armor with silverplate does not grant its DR to its wearer, but does gain it against attacks directed specifically at the armor. If you have the Quick Draw feat, you may draw the item as a free action once per turn.

SV,44,w,Slinker,"Slinker (SaV)
Weapon Upgrade

Only slugthrowers and missile weapons can be upgraded as slinkers. Once a weapon is made a slinker, it can no longer fire normal ammunition (and slinker ammunition costs twice the normal price). Slinkers are equipped with simple sensors and battle computers, and programmed to fly around obstacles or even around corners to strike a target.

If a slinker is fired at a target with cover (but not total cover), the target does not gain the normal +5 cover bonus to its Reflex Defense. If an attacker wants to fire a slinker at a target with total cover (where the attacker cannot see, such as around a corner), the attacker selects a specific target square outside his line of sight and makes an attack with a +0 bonus against anything in that square. (This tactic is effective with area attacks, which can strike close enough to do damage even when poorly aimed). The path from the attacker to the target square cannot have more than a single turn (maximum 90 degrees).

A targeting scope is a sighting device that makes it easier to hit distant targets. However, it affords a very limited field of view, making it difficult to use. Installing a targeting scope on a rifle or pistol requires 10 minutes and a DC 10 Mechanics check.

Standard: A standard targeting scope reduces the range by one category (for example, from medium to short range). However, you must aim at your target to gain this benefit, and you lose the benefit if you change targets or lose line of sight to your target (see Aim, page 154).

A trapped grip requires the wielder to perform some free action (usually pressing down on a hidden sensor, twisting a nondescript knob, or some other mundane task) before activating the lightsaber safely. If the wielder does not perform this task at the time the weapon activates, the wielder takes 1d6 points of energy damage, and again at the start of his or her turn until the trap is deactivated. Deactivating the trap is a free action that is performed as a part of activating the weapon, and a DC 20 Perception check can reveal the trap mechanism and the disarming action.

SV,47,X,Weapon mount,"Weapon Mounts (SaV)
Armor Upgrade

Armor can add any equipment using the Integrated Equipment upgrade (see above), but dedicated weapon mounts allow weapons to be added more efficiently. The number of weapon mounts gained for each upgrade slot spent is a function of the class of armor upgraded: Light armor gains 2 weapon mounts, medium armor gains 3 mounts, and heavy armor gains 4 mounts.

A two-handed weapon requires 2 mounts, a one-handed weapon requires 1 mount, and a light weapon requires only half of a mount. You must be proficient with both the weapon and the armor on which is it mounted to be considered proficient with a mounted weapon. (Any weapon described as gloves or gauntlets, such as combat gloves, can be worn with armor without a weapon mount, but only one such weapon can be worn at a time.)

This upgrade does not include the cost of the weapons to be mounted. Such weapons are designed only for mount use, and can't be fired as hand-held weapons. It takes 10 minutes and a DC 10 Mechanics check to change weapons in a mount. A mounted weapon can't be disarmed, and it need not be drawn to be used. Weapons in mounts are obvious unless the weapon mount is con足cealed (multiply upgrade cost by 3), in which case it takes a DC 25 Perception check to notice the weapon when it is not in use. A mounted weapon does not gain any benefit from the armor if the weapon takes damage.

If an autonomous weapon (see above) is mounted to a suit of armor, it is automatically considered seated (and thus can make attacks while the armor's wearer takes other actions). However, autonomous weapons can distract and unbalance the wearer due to their recoil, though heavier armors are better at absorbing this shock. For every autonomous mounted weapon that has made an attack within the last round (that is, since wearer's last turn), the wearer must spend a swift action to regain balance; furthermore, the wearer takes a penalty on all attack rolls and Dexterity- or Strength-based skill checks determined by the class of armor worn: light -10, medium -5, heavy -2.
