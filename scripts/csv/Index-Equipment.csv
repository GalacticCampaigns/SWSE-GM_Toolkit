R,51,w,Ambient aural amplifier,"Ambient Aural Amplifier (RECG)

Although aural amplifiers have existed for centuries, vast improvements to the technology are made during the Rebellion era, driven by the need to sur­reptitiously listen in on contacts who could be Imperial spies, Rebel recruiters, or bounty hunters looking to make a few quick credits. Previous models of aural amplifiers were bulky and obvious, and they garbled messages almost as often as they worked. They also required power cells, limiting the degree to which they could be concealed.

Employing the same technology used for protocol droids, the new ambi­ent aural amplifiers can pick out sounds, analyze them, and amplify only the sounds that are likely to be useful. These devices draw power from the body heat of any warm-blooded creature that wears them, giving the amplifiers an effectively unlimited operation time. (Cold-blooded species can power the devices by placing them on a warm surface or piece of gear.) The result is a +5 equipment bonus to Perception checks to eavesdrop or to hear distant or ambient noises.

An antidote synthesizer is a small, portable device that takes the portability of a microlab one step farther. If an antidote to a poison or a toxin is needed and proper medical attention is not immediately available, an antidote syn­thesizer can be used to help the victim survive. The synthesizer can analyze a small amount of poison or toxin inserted into the machine's sample tube, and within 1d6 rounds it can create 1d4 doses of antivenom or antitoxin that each grant a +2 bonus to a Treat Injury check made to treat the poison or toxin. To reproduce an antidote after the doses are expended, however, requires a new sample of the poison or toxin.

This large, specialized tank is filled with the powerful healing agent, bacta, which promotes rapid healing.

A bacta tank can be used in conjunction with surgery (see Treat Injury skill, page 74). If the Treat Injury check is successful, the patient heals a number of hit points equal to its character level in addition to that provided by Surgery.

A bacta tank can also be used when treating disease, poison, or radiation in a creature. In this case, the bacta tank grants a +5 equipment bonus on your Treat Injury check.

A bacta tank and a supply of bacta is expensive, so such medical equipment is usually found only in hospitals, aboard capital ships, and within major military bases. Each hour of treatment consumes one liter of bacta, which costs 100 credits. A typical tank holds up to 300 liters of bacta, and the tank must hold at least 150 liters at all times to provide any benefit. Only one creature can be immersed in the tank at any given time.

After the battle of Malachor V, Bao-Dur designs and builds himself a unique cybernetic arm that uses an energy binding in place of a mechanical elbow. The arm has normal Human strength. By manipulating the energy binding during combat, Bao-Dur can disrupt an opponent's personal energy shield as well as some other force fields. The energy cell must be recharged every 48 hours, though Bao-Dur has included a variety of attachments to ensure he can recharge it from a variety of sources in an emergency.

Shield Breaker

To disrupt a field, Bao-Dur must be adjacent to the target and make a successful unarmed strike. If the attack hits, shields with an SR rating of 15 or lower are disabled and provide no protection for the rest of the encounter. If the shield has a rating greater than SR 15, the shield rating drops by -5, failing once it falls to SR 15 or lower.

All Imperial Knights wear specially designed gauntlets made of cortosis weave that protect them from the normally lethal lightsaber blades. If the wearer readies an action to block a lightsaber attack, the wearer can make an opposed unarmed melee attack roll against the attack roll of the lightsaber attack. If the wearer of the cortosis gauntlet is successful, the lightsaber deactivates and may not be reactivated for 2 minutes. The attack still deals normal damage before the lightsaber is deactivated.

If the wearer of a cortosis gauntlet is the target of the Severing Strike talent, the attacker can choose to sever the limb where the cortosis gauntlet is worn without having his or her lightsaber deactivated.

CR,134,w,Credit chip,"Credit Chip

The credit chip is a small, flat card that features a security codeout and credit algorithm memory stripes. The chip can hold a specified number of credits appropriate to the government that issued it, or it can draw from a specific account held by the user. Credit chips not only allow quick and easy transfers of funds but also protect users from theft.

Credit chips are storage devices with Intelligence 10 and Will Defense 15. Improving your access to a credit chip is very difficult because the chip has a starting attitude of hostile (see page 75). Once it is friendly, you can draw from the account to which it is linked. If you fail by 5 or more on your Use Computer check to improve access, the credit chip's security program detects the intrusion attempt and self-destructs.

Modifying a credit chip so that government and bank computers think that it draws on a different account or that it has a different value stored is almost impossible: The central bank's computers have Will Defense 30 and a starting attitude of hostile (see page 75); even worse, you won't know if your check succeeded until after you attempt to use the modified credit chip. If you fail, the government or bank computer orders the chip's self-destruct programming to activate, ruining the chip. If you fail by 5 or more, the chip's self-destruct programming activates and the government or bank computer has traced your location, dispatching security personnel to apprehend you .

GW,46,X,Cryogenic pouch,"Cryogenic Pouch (GaW)

A cryogenic pouch is a medical device that can stabilize critically wounded soldiers in the field. It comes in a small canister worn on a soldier's belt or stored in a medical kit. Opening the canister releases a pouch large enough to hold a single Medium creature. When the pouch is sealed, it releases a cryogenic compound that causes the creature inside to enter suspended animation, stabilizing his or her condition for transport to a proper medi­cal facility. Bounty hunters sometimes use of cryogenic pouches to move prisoners.

Activating a cryogenic pouch and wrapping it around an unconscious creature requires a full round action. A creature that has been reduced to 0 hit points due to poison, radiation, or damage surpassing its Damage Threshold can be stabilized without dying within 1d3 rounds of being placed inside the cryogenic pouch. The creature remains unconscious and moves -5 steps on the condition track.

A cryogenic pouch has enough power to keep a creature alive for up to 24 hours, although it can be hooked up to another power source with a DC 10 Mechanics check. Designed for rough handling in battlefield conditions, the pouch has DR 5, but a single point of damage is enough to breach the seal. If the cryogenic pouch is breached, the character inside reverts to its previous state after 1 round.

Prosthetic replacements in the Star Wars universe frequently take the form of mechanical simulations powered by tiny high-capacity battery packs and motivated by the recipient's bioelectrical impulses. In effect, someone who loses a limb or an extremity can have an electronic replacement that acts (and in some cases looks) just like the original.

Cybernetic prosthetic devices are unusual, but hardly rare. Luke Skywalker gains a cybernetic replacement for his right hand, lost in battle against Darth Vader-who, in turn, had much of his own body replaced with cybernetics years before.

Attaching a cybernetic prosthesis requires the Cybernetic Surgery feat (see page 83). Once attached, the cybernetic replacement performs as well as the original limb or extremity. Common cybernetic prosthetics include arms, hands, legs, feet, and various internal organs. In addition to the cost of the prosthesis, the recipient must also cover the cost of the surgery (see Table 8-9: Services and Expenses, page 141).

Unlike other creatures, a creature with cybernetic prosthetics takes full damage from weapons and attacks that deal ion damage.

A holoshroud is an advanced form of holoprojector that places a stored holographic image of a creature over the form of the creature wearing the holoshroud. This creates a nearly perfect visual illusion that moves, acts, and reacts with the wearer. A typical model is the Corellidyne CQ-3.9x Holographic Image Disguiser, though it's far from the only holoshroud on the market. The CQ-3.9x is able to store a single holographic image to disguise the wearer, though it can be changed if the user has access to other holographic images and makes a DC 15 Use Computer check.

Using a holoshroud gives you a +10 equipment bonus on Deception checks made to produce a deceptive appearance that matches the holographic image within the holoshroud. Creating or removing this deceptive appearance is a swift action (to turn the holoshroud on or off), which is not considered a rushed deception and does not take a -10 penalty for lacking the proper time.

GI,67,w,Redirection Crystal,"Redirection Crystal (GoI)

A redirection crystal is filled with Tibanna gas and has a small blasting tube. Snipers and assassins use them to seemingly bank blaster shots, allowing the shooter to hide in one location while making a shot appear to come from another position. When struck by blaster fire, the gas inside the crys­tal explodes, directing the shot through the blast tube at the established angle. Only skilled snipers and assassins use redirection crystals because of the sheer difficulty in making a successful strike. Redirection crystals are sometimes used in conjunction with the Xerrol nightstinger (see page 64), taking advantage of the weapon's invisible blaster shot to confuse the enemy.

A redirection crystal is Fine size, giving it Reflex Defense 15, plus penalties for distance. If an attack with a blaster weapon successfully hits the redirec­tion crystal, make a second attack roll against the intended target, with a -10 penalty and additional range-increment penalties. The redirection crystal is destroyed, leaving only minuscule fragments, requiring a DC 30 Percep­tion check to notice and a DC 30 Knowledge (technology) check to identify.

This footwear allows the wearer to float a short distance above the ground. Repulsor boots use a tiny repulsorlift unit in the sole of each boot to elevate the wearer up to 0.5 meters above the ground. With careful manipulation and positioning of one's feet, the boots can be used to move, but users cannot exceed a movement rate of 2 squares per round with this method. Although they are not an optimal method of travel, repulsor boots are a great aid in climbing, granting the wearer a +10 equipment bonus to Climb checks.

When a large or heavy object needs to be moved and a speeder is not avail­able, a repulsor hitch can be used instead. The hitch is a small repulsorlift encased in a durasteel shell that can be attached to a cable or another extension. When activated, a repulsor hitch can lift items weighing up to 200 kg, enabling them to be moved. Explorers find that the hitch is especially useful for transporting large creatures. Objects weighing more than 200 kg are not affected by the hitch, since the repulsor field is not strong enough to lift the entire mass. Some droid models, such as the MULE droid (page 45), are designed to allow a hitch to be attached to their chassis, allowing the droids to move heavy objects.

A repulsor pad is used mostly to ease manual labor. In essence, it is a flat board with four repulsors, one at each corner, that can be used to lift heavy objects for short-range transport. This allows a single worker to move a heavy crate or other object without the need to use a vehicle or a binary load lifter. During the Dark Times, the repulsor pad is often used by saboteurs to transport heavy machinery or by thieves to cart off large objects without the need to use noisy vehicles or droids. Each repulsor pad occupies a single square and can be used to lift an object that occupies no more space than that single square; multiple repulsor pads can be used to lift larger objects. Activating a repulsor pad (or a group of pads) is a swift action, and a repulsor pad can move along with a character if that character uses a swift action to grab and drag the pad. If two creatures attempt to pull a repulsor pad in opposite directions, they make opposed Strength checks, and the pad moves along with the victor.

A shield cage is a large flat disk, 2 meters in diameter. It must be connected to a power supply to operate and drains portable power generators after 2 hours of continuous use.

A shield cage produces a shield bubble that fills a single square. Multiple shield cages can be linked together, each expanding the shielded area by one additional square. Targets are trapped inside and cannot move until the power is turned off. The shield is air permeable, allowing the target to breathe and communicate verbally, but nothing else can pass through the shield except damage that exceeds the shield's rating (SR 15).

Though most Sith amulets were destroyed by Jedi shadows in the wake of the Great Sith War, a few remain, hidden away in Sith burial chambers on Korriban and elsewhere throughout the galaxy.

The wearer of a Sith amulet gains several benefits:

• When the wearer uses the Move Light Object application of the Use the Force skill, the object being used as a projectile deals 2d6 points of damage instead of 1d6 points.

• When the wearer activates a Force power with the [telekinetic} descriptor, the wearer can increase his Dark Side Score by 1 to reroll the Use the Force check made to activate the power, keeping the better res ult.

• As a standard action, the wearer can increase his Dark Side Score by 1 and select a target within 12 squares.

Locked away in the mausoleums dedicated to ancient Sith Lords are thousands of scrolls, tomes, and tab lets bearing instructions on how to master a variety of Sith techniques. Like Sith holocrons, these ancient writings describe the methods of using lost dark side Force powers, the construction of Sith weapons and artifacts, information on Sith alchemy, and treatises on the domination and destruction of others.

Sith scrolls, tomes, and tablets function in much the same was as a holocron for the purposes of learning new Force powers and talents. However, these writings have no gatekeeper, and as such their knowledge is open to anyone who can master them, given time. Searchers should beware; many ancient Sith writings are imbued with the madness of their creators, and the knowledge they contain has been known to drive the unprepared student to insanity.

The Madness of Knowledge (CL 6): The first time a character reads an ancient Sith tome, scroll, or tablet, make an attack (1d20+8) against the character's Will Defense. If the attack succeeds, the character moves -2 persistent steps down the condition track, and until the persistent condition is removed the character takes a -5 penalty to Will Defense (on top of the normal penalties for being moved down the condition track). Also, until the persistent condition is remove d, the character is filled with paranoia and creeping insanity, and any time the character rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll, his next attack roll made before the end of the encounter must be against an ally, not an enemy.

You need a tool kit to reprogram a droid or to repair a damaged droid or vehicle. A tool kit also makes repairing devices much simpler.

The standard tool kit represents a broad collection of tools designed to take apart, analyze, modify, and rebuild almost any technological device.

Most technicians personalize their tool kits over the course of years, but almost all contain at least an electroshock probe (for shorting out electronic components or soldering wires), fusion cutter (for cutting apart durasteel and similar materials), hydrospanner (to tighten and loosen all forms of screws and fasteners), laser welder (for connecting things), power calibrator (both for analyzing circuitry and to act as an emergency power cell), power prybar (for forcing things open), probe sensors, sonic welder (for connecting things when you can't afford a fire), various circuits and connector wires, vibrocutters (for things that don't call for a fusion cutter), and welding goggles (so you don't burn out your eyes).

Many of these tools can be used as makeshift weapons. They all qualify as simple weapons, but since they aren't designed for combat, they impose a -5 penalty on attack rolls.

The veridicator can be programmed for only a single species at a time. Changing the settings requires a DC 10 Use Computer check.

GI,67,R,Vid-Vox Scrambler,"Vid-Vox Scrambler (GoI)

When activated, this Tiny handheld device emits a low-frequency wave that scrambles all video, audio, and holographic recording within its area of effect, while leaving normal conversation unaffected. Vid-vox scramblers are prized by anyone worried that their conversations are being recorded, including criminal masterminds, CEOs, spies, and the paranoid.

The vid-vox scrambler prevents all video, audio, and holographic record­ing in the squares adjacent to and the square including the device. Anyone eavesdropping or reviewing recordings of targets protected by an interference generator must make a DC 30 Perception or Use Computer check to pick up only scattered words and phrases. A scrambler can operate continuously for one week on a single power cell, or it can be connected to a generator or other permanent power source.

C,66,w,Visual wrist comm,"Visual Wrist Comm (CWCG)

The visual wrist comm is popular with smugglers and soldiers. The comm is a small, flat, rectangular panel that easily attaches to a glove or other flat surface. The comm sends and receives audio and visual signals, and it can display holographic information, though only as a two-dimensional image. It has a range of up to 75 kilometers while planetside – sufficient to reach orbital range-and runs on a single energy cell, which must be replaced after 10 days of continuous use. In addition, the wrist comm functions as a simple datapad that stores and receives information from droids, comm signals, direct computer links, and standard data cards.

UR,42,w,Water extractor,"Water Extractor (UR)

For organic beings, water is a necessity of life. Some worlds have abundant water, but others lack this vital liquid. The water extractor can help beings who find themselves on a dry world. Working like a condensing canteen found in a field kit, the water extractor is a cone-shaped apparatus that attracts water vapor from the air, collecting it in specialized bins at the broad end of the cone. As the water accumulates, contaminants and toxins are filtered out, rendering the water potable. Although the amount of water collected varies depending on the moisture content of the atmosphere, field tests conducted on Tatooine yielded enough water in a period of 16 hours to sustain a humanoid for a full day.

This stealth pack uses the Galactic Alliance Core Fleet's knowledge of their former computer systems to conceal a slicer's presence on a former or current Galactic Alliance computer or network.

Using a computer equipped with this software package, you can slice into a system without being traced, isolated, or cut off by the system's automatic safeguards. If another character attempts to locate, isolate, or cut off your computer, make opposed Use Computer checks. The stealth pack grants a +5 equipment bonus to your check.

Among the array of tools available to the Galactic Alliance Core Fleet is this portable computer designed to quickly slice through the standard security in Galactic Alliance computer systems and networks. This is useful when the Galactic Alliance Core Fleet is forced to slice systems in former Galactic Alliance installations and ships. While the Empire has overlaid many systems with its own security, and has its own military systems, most of the former Galactic Alliance bureaucratic systems still exist under the surface.

Once inside, Galactic Alliance Core Fleet personnel quickly dissect it, as the systems are very similar or virtually identical to the systems they use every day on their own ships.

The Xcalq-3GA may be used as a regular portable computer and has Intelligence 14. However, when used to slice Galactic Alliance systems and networks, the opposing system is automatically treated as friendly or helpful, granting a +3 equipment bonus on all Use Computer checks made with that computer. This bonus does not apply to checks made to break through any initial Imperial security installed on the system.
