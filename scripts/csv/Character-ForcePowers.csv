Draining droids: If you allow droids to be affected by this power, a GM might give a -1 circumstance modifier per each two CLs of the target droid. 

Draining a lightsaber: Repairing a short circuited lightsaber is just a diceless action taking a minute as stated on page 60 of the JATM. Simply replacing the energy cell should be a lot easier than that.[/quote]Nice find! I think it should likewise take a minute to repair a Drained lightsaber as it does to repair a ""shorted"" lightsaber. 

If you ""Drain"" a blaster, the target can just ""reload"" another power pack and make it work again. There's nothing in the rules that disallows reloading a lightsaber. But I can't find anything in the rules that allows it either. It's not like it has an easy-to-replace power pack like a blaster weapon. I've looked at the inner-workings of a lightsaber and there doesn't seem to be any easy way of replacing the energy cell. The energy cell seems well integrated into the weapon. Perhaps a GM would allow you to use the Repair Object application of the Mechanics skill, but this normally takes 1 hour.]]

Compare the result to the target's Fortitude Defense. If the check result equals or exceeds the target's Fortitude Defense, the target is captured within the whirlwind and immobilized until the beginning of your next turn. Any attack rolls or skill checks the target attempts while within the whirlwind are at a -5 penalty. The target falls prone when the effect ends. The target also sustains damage at the end of your turn as determined by the results of your Use the Force check.

DC 15: The target takes 1d6 points of Force damage.

DC 20: The target takes 2d6 points of Force damage.

DC 25: The target takes 3d6 points of Force damage.

DC 30: The target takes 4d6 points of Force damage.

The target adds a size modifier to its Fortitude Defense: Colossal, +50; Gargantuan, +20; Huge, +10; Large, +5; Medium and smaller, +0.

Special: You can spend a Force Point to increase the penalty to the target's attack rolls and skill checks from -5 to -10.

You can maintain Force whirlwind from round to round, extending the normal duration. Maintaining the Force whirlwind power is a move action, and you must make a new Use the Force check each round. If you take damage while maintaining a Force whirlwind, you must succeed on a Use the Force check (DC = 15 + damage taken) to continue maintaining the power. If a target within a Force whirlwind is attacked or otherwise damaged or moved down the condition track by you or one of your allies, the effects of Force whirlwind end immediately.

[[Personal note:: When a creature is immobilized it cannot move by its own volition. An immobilized creature can take move actions, but it cannot move from its current space, (It also can perform swift or standard actions) but it cannot move from its current space, and it cannot make skill checks associated with movement (such as Acrobatics, Climb, Jump, or Swim). An immobilized creature can still be moved by other effects, such as being the target of a Bantha Rush or the Force Thrust power.]]

If you deal damage with the move object power, you cease to be able to maintain it.

If you use move object against a hovering or flying target (such as a speeder or starship), the target can oppose your Use the Force check with a grapple check as a reaction. If the target wins the opposed check, you are unable to move the target.

You may spend a Force Point to increase the maximum size of the object by one category and deal an additional 2d6 points of damage (maximum size Colossal [frigate], 12d6 damage). Alternatively, you may spend a Destiny Point (see page 112) to increase the maximum size of the object by three categories and deal an additional 6d6 points of damage (maximum size Colossal [station], 16d6 damage). 

Official clarification: You cannot use the Move Object to ""fly"" yourself around. You need Force Flight for that. You also cannot fly by holding on to an object targeted by the Move Object power. The buddy system doesn't work either. A friend may use Move Object to lift you off the ground, but he cannot do so if he is being flown via Move Object himself by another (such as by you).

[[House rule for forcing open doors: Your Move Object check must beat the Break DC of the door (see Core page 151). This means you still need to beat a high DC of 45 to open a blast door.]]

Unleashed: When you hurl one object or character into another object or character and you spend a Destiny Point, multiply the damage dealt by 2.

Official Clarification: You cannot use the Negate Energy power against the Force Lightning power. Negate Energy specifies it negates ""weapon energy damage."" Force Lightning is a Force power, not a weapon. Thus, no you cannot use Negate Energy against a Force Lightning attack.

[[Personal note: The DC to negate stun damage is the full stun damage before halving. Also, from a game balance perspective, it would be better for the DC to negate stun damage be the full number rolled before halving. This takes into account that stun damage is terrible in Saga.]]
