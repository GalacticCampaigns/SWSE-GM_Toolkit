When stressed, particularly when caught in mischief, he defaults to using \"we\" instead of \"I.\" Despite his pervasive fearfulness (especially of sudden loud noises or chaotic situations), Wexal possesses an uncanny knack for discovering forgotten accessways, hidden nooks, and lost items throughout the Chu'unthor II.

                "summary": "Captain Thorne is a rock of stability in a sea of chaos. His calm demeanor under extreme pressure inspires confidence in his crew. He is a man of few words, preferring decisive action and clear orders over lengthy debate, but he listens intently to his key officers (Heston, Gaxx, his bridge crew, and Council liaisons like Davion). He values experience, competence, and loyalty above all. While not Force-sensitive, he has a profound respect for the Jedi's wisdom and abilities, and a deep, personal loyalty to Master Altis. He carries the weight of command heavily but never lets it break his resolve.",

The Empire immediately branded the Jedi as traitors who orchestrated the war and initiated the Great Jedi Purge to hunt down and eliminate all survivors. Early Imperial policies focused on consolidating power, reorganizing Republic institutions into Imperial ones (e.g., Imperial Senate with diminished power, Imperial Military), and suppressing dissent. Regional governors (Moffs) were appointed to oversee systems, and the Inquisitorius was established to aid in hunting Jedi survivors.",
